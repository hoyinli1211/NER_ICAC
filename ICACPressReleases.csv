16/6/2022,Civil servant couple charged by ICAC face additional charge of maintaining living standard above official emoluments involving $12m cash deposits,"The ICAC today (June 16) laid an additional charge of maintaining a living standard above the official emoluments against a Senior Building Services Engineer of the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) and a Clinical Psychologist of the Social Welfare Department (SWD). The civil servant couple and a subcontractor of the EMSD were earlier charged with bribery, misconduct in public office (MIPO) and laundering crime proceeds in a case involving minor works contracts worth about $91.4 million of the EMSD.Upon further legal advice from the Department of Justice, Zsa Sing-tak, 57, Senior Building Services Engineer of the EMSD; Zsa’s wife Ng Wai-shan, 50, Clinical Psychologist of the SWD, were today jointly laid an additional charge of being a prescribed officer maintaining a standard of living above that commensurate with his official emoluments, contrary to sections 10(1)(a) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO).The duo and co-defendant Chan Tsz-wing, 55, subcontractor of the EMSD, will appear in the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts next Monday (June 20) for mention.  An application will be made at a later stage to have the case committed to the High Court.  The additional charge alleges that between January 2012 and August 2019, Zsa, together with Ng, maintained a standard of living above that commensurate with Zsa’s official emoluments.ICAC investigation revealed that during the above period, the two civil servants, Zsa and Ng, each received over 200 cash deposits in the total amount of about $12 million. The couple’s total known source of funds was about $40 million, including their official emoluments totalling about $15 million. However, they were able to spend over $52 million, which exceeded their official emoluments and any other known sources by about $12 million.Section 10 of the POBO states that it is an offence if any person holding an office of emolument under the Government, including a civil servant, maintains a standard of living above that which is commensurate with his official emoluments, or is in control of property disproportionate to his emoluments, unless he gives a satisfactory explanation to the court. Any person who violates this section is liable on conviction to a maximum penalty of a 10-year imprisonment and a fine of $1 million.Since its inception in 1974, the ICAC has strived to uphold a clean civil service and enforced the POBO vigorously to detect and weed out any corrupt conduct of public servants.The ICAC earlier brought nine charges against Zsa, Ng and Chan, namely one of public servant accepting an advantage, one of offering an advantage to a public servant, two of MIPO, and five of dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of an indictable offence.Zsa joined the EMSD in 1991 and was promoted to Senior Building Services Engineer in October 2014. Since August 2013, he was posted to Minor Works Sub-Division under Municipal Sector Division. He was responsible for handling and overseeing tendering and operations of public works contracts. At the material time, his wife, Ng, was a Clinical Psychologist of the SWD.Between October 2016 and April 2018, the Minor Works Sub-Division in which Zsa was working awarded two minor works contracts at about $91.4 million to two main contractors. The contracts were subsequently subcontracted to three subcontractors in which Chan was the director-cum-shareholder.According to the Circular issued by the Civil Service Bureau and the Guide on Conduct and Discipline issued by the EMSD, its staff members should avoid any conflict of interest with any tenderer and are required to declare any conflict of interest in relation to a tendering exercise and the subsequent contract management.It is alleged that Zsa and Chan respectively accepted and offered $40,000, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, as an inducement to or reward for Zsa being or remaining favourably disposed to the above three subcontractors or other companies.Zsa had allegedly willfully misconducted himself in the course of or in relation to his public office, without reasonable excuse or justification, by failing to declare his conflict of interest arising from his personal friendship with Chan and another person, both directors of subcontractors of the above EMSD contracts in respect of which Zsa was responsible for the management and supervision of the performance of the contractors.In addition, Zsa and Ng had allegedly dealt with a total of over $9.5 million deposited into four bank accounts of them, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that they in whole or in part, directly or indirectly represented the proceeds of an indictable offence.Arising from the same investigation, Ng alone faces four counts of fraud in a separate case which involved four mortgage and personal loans totalling over $7.3 million.The EMSD and the SWD have rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the cases.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1363.html

4/6/2022,Two former senior executives of construction companies charged by ICAC in $75.3m L/C scam jailed for four years,"Two former senior executives of two construction companies, charged by the ICAC, were today (June 4) each sentenced to four years’ imprisonment at the District Court for conspiracy to defraud for their roles in a $75.3 million letters of credit (L/Cs) scam, and laundering over $10 million in crime proceeds.The defendants were Wang Xiaoshan, 53, former deputy general manager of China Railway Construction (HK) Limited (CRCL); and Lau Chung-hoi, 55, then director of now defunct Top Famous Construction Engineering Limited (TFCL).Deputy Judge Mr Charles Chan also ordered Lau be disqualified from being a director of any company for six years.The duo were earlier found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law. Lau was further convicted of two counts of dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence, contrary to Section 25(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance.CRCL is a subsidiary of publicly listed China Railway Construction Corporation Limited (CRCC). China Railway International Trading (HK) Limited (CRITL) is another wholly owned subsidiary of CRCC, which is run by staff members of CRCL to source construction materials for CRCL and its associated companies.The court heard that at the material time, Wang was a deputy general manager of CRCL responsible for business development, while Lau was a director of TFCL.In September 2016, Wang arranged TFCL and CRCL to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to form joint ventures to take up certain construction projects. Afterwards, TFCL requested CRCL to assist in financing its purchase of materials and CRCL agreed.In December 2016, Wang arranged TFCL to further enter into three trade agreements with CRITL whereby CRITL would act as TFCL’s purchasing agent for procuring construction materials from a supplier for three construction projects, and payments would be settled by L/Cs granted by DBS Bank Limited (DBS Bank) to CRCL.In January 2017, CRITL submitted three applications to DBS Bank for issuing three L/Cs in favour of the above supplier.

As a result, DBS Bank approved all of the applications and released three L/Cs payments totalling HK$75.3 million to the supplier.ICAC inquiries revealed that there was no such trade transaction. Wang arranged signing of the MOU and the three trade agreements to procure granting of the above L/Cs. The supporting documents produced by Lau were false documents and he had dealt with proceeds totalling HK$10.5 million arising from the scam.CRCC, CRCL, CRITL and DBS Bank had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Olivia Tsang, assisted by ICAC officers Raymond Yung and Joe Gza Li.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1349.html
2/6/2022,Former executive director of listed company and wife charged by ICAC with fraud for concealing interests in $110m loans,"The ICAC today (June 2) charged a former executive director of a listed company, his wife and another person for allegedly conspiring together to defraud The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK) and the listed company by concealing the wife’s interests in a borrower when the listed company granted two loans totalling over $70 million to it. The executive director was also charged with fraud for allegedly concealing his wife’s interests in the borrower in another loan of $40 million.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. Upon completion of the investigation, the ICAC sought legal advice from the Department of Justice, which advised charging the trio.Yuen Chi-ping, 43, former executive director and chief executive officer of Applied Development Holdings Limited (Applied Development); Lee Lap-kuen, 42, wife of Yuen and former director-cum-shareholder of On Tai International Credit Limited (On Tai); and Cheng Yee-fong, 44, former shareholder of On Tai; jointly face two counts of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law. Yuen further faces two fraud charges alternative to the above charges.Yuen alone faces two other charges – one of fraud and one of publishing a false statement, respectively contrary to Section 16A and Section 21(1) of the Theft Ordinance.The defendants were released on ICAC bail, pending their appearance in the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts next Tuesday (June 7) for transferring the case to the District Court.At the material time, Yuen was an executive director of publicly listed Applied Development. Applied Development and its directors were required to comply with the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the SEHK (Listing Rules), including making timely, complete and accurate disclosures on connected transactions.The offences took place between January 2018 and June 2019. During the period, Applied Development entered into three loan agreements of totalling over $110 million with On Tai.Two of the charges allege that the three defendants conspired with other persons to defraud the SEHK, Applied Development and its board of directors, shareholders and potential investors by dishonestly concealing the interests of Lee in On Tai, and two loan agreements between Applied Development and On Tai as connected transactions.The above concealments caused Applied Development to grant two loans totalling over $70 million to On Tai without complying with the relevant Listing Rules to make appropriate disclosures, and the SEHK not to raise any enquiries in relation to the two loan agreements nor to request Applied Development to comply with the relevant Listing Rules to make appropriate disclosures.Another charge alleges that Yuen, with intent to defraud, concealed from Applied Development and its board of directors the interests of Lee in On Tai, and a loan agreement between Applied Development and On Tai as a connected transaction, so as to induce Applied Development to grant a loan of $40 million to On Tai without complying with the relevant Listing Rules to make an appropriate disclosure.ICAC investigation revealed that Yuen married Lee during the above period. After they got married, they had allegedly arranged Cheng to hold part of Lee’s shares of On Tai on her behalf so as to conceal Lee’s interests in On Tai.The remaining charge alleges that Yuen, being a director of Applied Development, with intent to deceive members or creditors of the company about its affairs, concurred in publishing the annual report of Applied Development for the year 2018 which might be misleading or false.It was revealed in ICAC’s investigation that the aforesaid annual report did not disclose any connected transaction.The SEHK and Applied Development have rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation.The ICAC reminds directors and senior executives of listed companies to adhere to their legal and ethical obligations when conducting businesses so as to safeguard the interest of different stakeholders.

1/6/2022,Engineering company director charged by ICAC jailed for 39 months  over $23m hotel development project fraud,"A director of an engineering company, charged by the ICAC, was today (June 1) sentenced to 39 months’ imprisonment at the District Court for conspiring with a director of a consultancy firm to deceive a project developer into awarding a plumbing and drainage installation contract of a hotel development project worth $23 million to the engineering company.Ma Sau-kam, 60, director of Panocean Engineering Limited (Panocean), was earlier found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law.In sentencing, Deputy Judge Ms Katherine Lo Kit-yee said she took a starting point of 48 months’ imprisonment in view of the breach of trust and the monetary amount involved in this case. Having considered the mitigating factors, the defendant’s jail term was reduced to 39 months.The court heard that at the material time, co-defendant Wong Wing-chau was the sole director and shareholder of Saneseed Limited (Saneseed), an electrical and mechanical consultant. Wong’s son and Ma were both directors and shareholders of Panocean, an engineering company. Meanwhile, Ma was also an employee of Gloryfield Engineering Limited (Gloryfield), another company of Wong which shared Saneseed’s office.Champion Success Limited (Champion) was the project developer of a hotel redevelopment project in Mongkok. In March 2011, Champion named Saneseed as an electrical and mechanical consultant of the project to provide consultancy service covering fire services installation, electrical installation, mechanical ventilation and air conditioning installation, as well as plumbing and drainage installation (the four works areas).Saneseed was required to assist Champion in drawing up a tender list for the four works areas and choosing a suitable contractor. Saneseed would also supervise and monitor the relevant works conducted.Panocean was one of the contractors recommended by Wong to submit tenders for the works on the four areas. The total bidding price quoted by Panocean, which amounted to over $103 million, was not among the lowest three bids. But Champion still considered Panocean’s bid and invited it to attend the relevant tender interviews as Wong highly recommended Panocean.Upon the arrangement by Wong and Ma, two “managers” of Panocean attended the tender interviews hosted by Wong and representatives of Champion. Champion subsequently awarded the plumbing and drainage installation contract to Panocean at over $23 million in August 2014.After obtaining the plumbing and drainage installation contract, Panocean subcontracted the relevant works to another company without the permission of Champion.The court heard that Wong had never declared to Champion that his son was a director of Panocean nor had he declared to Champion his own interests in and relationship with Panocean. Wong had also induced Champion to award the contract to Panocean by fraudulent means. Should Champion know Wong’s interests in and relationship with Panocean, it would not have invited Panocean to submit tenders or awarded the contract to Panocean.ICAC inquires revealed that Panocean had no employee. An employee of Gloryfield and a business partner of Wong attended the above tender interviews as “managers” of Panocean. All tendering documents of Panocean were prepared and submitted to Champion by Ma upon Wong’s instructions.In late April, Wong and Ma were jointly found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud. The court was informed today that Wong passed away in mid-May. The case was adjourned to August 5 to deal with matters relating to Wong’s sentence.The case arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the above offence.

The defendant was remanded in custody of the Correctional Services Department.The court heard that at the material time, the defendant was a licensed property agent employed by Centaline Property. She was posted to the Wong Chuk Hang Heung Yip Road Branch of Centaline Commercial.Centaline Property maintained a database for its agents to search and list properties for sale or lease. For leasing transaction of an industrial property, Centaline Property would generally charge both the landlord and the tenant one month’s rent as agency commission.In July 2018, the defendant logged on to the database to update the status of a property in an industrial building in Tin Wan as “open for lease”. Around a month later, the defendant received a client of Centaline Property who was looking for an office premises in Wong Chuk Hang for rent. The defendant recommended the above property in Tin Wan to the client, saying that it belonged to a friend of her.The client entered into a tenancy agreement with the landlord in September 2018 for leasing the Tin Wan property at a monthly rental of $47,800. The defendant then updated the status of the property on Centaline Property’s database to “not for lease”, but she did not report the leasing transaction to the company.Centaline Property terminated the defendant in early October 2018 after the above incident came to the knowledge of the company.

24/5/2022,Non-candidate charged by ICAC jailed for illegal conduct of incurring election expenses at 2016 LegCo Election,"A person charged by the ICAC was today (May 24) sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment at the District Court for engaging in illegal conduct at the 2016 Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election (the Election) by incurring election expenses totalling over $253,000 for placing six advertisements in two newspapers while he was neither a candidate nor an election expense agent.Tai Yiu-ting, 57, earlier pleaded guilty to four counts of engaging in illegal conduct at an election by incurring election expense, contrary to Section 23(1) of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance (ECICO).In sentencing, Judge Mr Anthony Kwok Kai-on remarked that the case was a serious one as it involved election expenses totalling over $200,000 for over 20 candidates. Supervision by the Electoral Affairs Commission was undermined and fairness of the Election was affected as election expenses were not examined because of the arrangement.The court heard that the Election was held on September 4, 2016. On various occasions before the Election, Tai, via a radio programme, press conferences and social media, introduced to voters a voting scheme. The goal of the scheme was to take half the seats in the LegCo by particular groups through recruiting voters to cast their votes for particular candidates based on recommendations to be provided by the scheme.On August 9, 2016, a half-page advertisement promoting the scheme and its goal was placed in both Ming Pao Daily News (Ming Pao) and Apple Daily. A full-page advertisement urging voters to cast their votes based on information provided by the scheme was also placed in the two newspapers on September 2 and 4, 2016.Advertisement fees totalling over $253,000 for the above six advertisements, respectively $133,540 for the three advertisements placed in Ming Pao and $120,000 for another three advertisements placed in Apple Daily, were settled by Eggs Alliance Company Limited (Eggs Alliance). Ip Kim-ching and Sek Sau-ching were both directors of Eggs Alliance and authorised signatories of its bank accounts.The court also heard that none of the candidates being promoted under the scheme had included or set out the advertisement fees in their election returns. Tai, Ip and Sek were not candidates or election expense agents of any candidates of the Election.Section 23(1) of the ECICO stipulates that it is an illegal conduct for a person, other than a candidate or a candidate’s election expense agent, to incur election expenses at or in connection with the election. Any expenditure incurred for promoting or prejudicing the election of a particular candidate or particular candidates should be counted as election expenses.The ICAC investigation arose from a complaint alleging breaches of the ECICO. Upon legal advice sought from the Department of Justice (DoJ), charges were preferred against Tai, Ip and Sek.Lawyers of Ip and Sek earlier made representations to dispose of their case by way of bind over orders, which was agreed by the DoJ. On April 25, the Judge imposed a 12-month bind over order at $40,000 each on the duo after they admitted in court the summary of facts of the case.The Registration and Electoral Office had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Alice Chan, assisted by ICAC officer Stephen Leung.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1340.html

The bribery offence he committed would undermine Hong Kong’s probity and was rejected by the society.The court heard that in August 2020, a hotel in Hung Hom underwent a road resurfacing project. The main contractor of the project subcontracted part of the project to a second-tier subcontractor, which further engaged the defendant as the third-tier subcontractor to conduct road drilling works.The road drilling works was mostly completed in late August 2020 and the defendant received part of the project payment of about $600,000.The defendant kept requesting a project coordinator of the main contractor to release the outstanding project payment. On September 5, 2020, the defendant invited the project coordinator to meet with him. During the meeting, he gave a roll of banknotes to the project coordinator.The court heard that the roll of banknotes consisted of a sum of about $2,000. The above project coordinator refused to accept the roll of banknotes and reported the matter to her supervisor on the same day. She believed that it was offered to her for her assistance in releasing the above outstanding project payment.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Kalvin Chan, assisted by ICAC officer Dominic Cheung.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1341.html
23/5/2022,Ex-CHP consultant charged by ICAC admits MIPO and fraud involving HK$4.2m service fees from overseas health organisations,"A former consultant of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP), charged by the ICAC, today (May 23) admitted at the District Court that he had committed misconduct in public office (MIPO) and fraud by abusing his official capacity for personal gain in tuberculosis (TB) drug testing and other services, worth totalling over HK$4.2 million, provided by the CHP to three international and overseas health organisations.Joseph Kam Kai-man, 64, former Consultant Medical Microbiologist of the CHP of the Department of Health (DH), pleaded guilty to six charges – four of MIPO, contrary to the Common Law; and two of fraud, contrary to Section 16A(1) of the Theft Ordinance. Meanwhile, the court ordered one of using a false instrument against the defendant be left on file at the District Court.Deputy Judge Ms Katherine Lo Kit-yee adjourned the case to June 17 for sentence. The defendant was remanded in custody of the Correctional Services Department.The case arose from a corruption complaint referred by the DH. The ICAC is grateful to all international, national and local authorities and parties concerned for their valuable assistance to the Commission during its investigation into the case, including arranging interviews with overseas witnesses in and outside Hong Kong.The defendant joined the DH in 1984 and assumed the post of Consultant Medical Microbiologist since 1997. The above offences took place between September 2005 and March 2014. During the eight and a half years, the defendant chiefly worked at the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP. He was in charge of a number of laboratories, including the Hong Kong Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (HKTRL) operated by the DH, which was recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a supranational reference laboratory for conducting anti-TB drug susceptibility testing.The defendant admitted that he had wilfully misconducted himself in the course of or in relation to his public office without reasonable excuse or justification. On different occasions, he had made false representations to three international and overseas organisations and their representatives that the Hong Kong Association of Medical Microbiologists (HKAMM) set up by him was a public institution which was the same as the DH, a working partner of the HKTRL or a non-profit agency equivalent to the HKTRL. He also falsely claimed that he had the authority of the DH or the HKTRL to enter into services agreements with the three organisations. Afterwards, he arranged the HKTRL to provide the relevant services to the three organisations and received payments from them through the HKAMM purportedly on behalf of the DH and the HKTRL.The three organisations concerned were the WHO, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND). The NIID, which conducted research on infectious diseases and developed vaccines, was a research institute attached to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. The FIND was a Switzerland-based non-profit organisation which supported the development of and access to diagnostics for infectious diseases in low-resource settings.ICAC inquiries revealed that the HKAMM was a non-profit making organisation set up in 1992 by the defendant and other local microbiologists upon his invitation. The defendant was its chairman between 1992 and 1999. Since then, he was in sole control of a bank account opened in the name of the HKAMM.The court heard that the defendant subsequently received through the above bank account grants totalling JPY15 million (about HK$1.28 million) from the NIID for organising seven workshops and a meeting relating to the tracking of foodborne infections.In addition, the defendant entered into three agreements with the WHO and signed two memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with the FIND, and received services fees of about US$64,000 (about HK$500,000) and about US$240,000 (about HK$1.86 million) respectively from the two organisations for HKTRL’s provision of anti-TB drug susceptibility testing services and relevant training and technical assistance.However, the defendant in fact did not have the DH’s approval for entering into and signing the above agreements and MoUs with those organisations. He subsequently caused staff members of the DH to organise events and provide services for those organisations without disclosing to the DH that he had received the grants and service fees from the organisations through the above bank account.The defendant started his pre-retirement leave in late September 2012 and retired from the DH in mid-April 2013. ICAC inquiries also revealed that during the pre-retirement leave, he had falsely represented to a representative of the WHO that the HKAMM was a “working partner” of the HKTRL, which had no independent bank account to receive payments from the WHO.As a result, the defendant induced the WHO representative to enter into three other agreements and transfer sums totalling about US$80,000 (about HK$620,000) in respect of the agreements on training and anti-TB drug susceptibility testing into the above bank account controlled by the defendant.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Newman Wong and Leon Chan, assisted by ICAC officer Cressida To.An ICAC spokesperson stressed that public medical professionals carry out important public health duties by providing reliable services to the community to safeguard the wellbeing of individual citizens.

They were among the 11 defendants jailed for up to 12 months for taking part in the above scam for arranging over 100 persons to register as members of a professional organisation with false qualifications and to become electors of the Information Technology Functional Constituency (ITFC) of the Election to facilitate them to vote for a particular candidate. Of the six persons, four of them were associated with a taxi association.The six defendants were Li Wai-man, 55, then corporate affairs director of Taxi Drivers & Operators Association (TDOA); Yeung Yiu-hung, 36, then vice secretary of TDOA; Poon Sau-fong, 53, then clerk of TDOA; Lui Ah-fook, 48, then executive committee member of TDOA; and Lui Wai-fong, 42, and Lui King-yin, 25, respectively younger sister and son of Lui Ah-fook.On October 22, 2021, they received jail sentences ranging from three to 12 months after pleading guilty to multiple charges – conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to engage in corrupt conduct at an election by offering an advantage to others and engaging in corrupt conduct at an election by accepting an advantage.The Department of Justice (DoJ) subsequently sought a review of their sentences. The application was today heard by Mr Justice Derek Pang Wai-cheong, Madam Justice Maggie Poon Man-kay and Madam Justice Anthea Pang Po-kam, all Justices of Appeal of the CA. In allowing the DoJ’s application, the CA increased the sentences of the six defendants to jail terms ranging from 10 months to 23 months.Li and Yeung Yiu-hung had their jail terms respectively increased to 23 months and 20 months. Poon and Lui Ah-fook were respectively ordered to serve 15 months and 11 months in jail. The sentences of Lui Wai-fong and Lui King-yin were also increased to 10 months.The court heard that the Election was held on September 4, 2016 and two candidates competed in the ITFC. At the material time, Li conspired together with Yeung Yiu-hung and Poon to defraud the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) by applying for full membership in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., Hong Kong Section (IEEE) for TDOA members with false information about their professional qualification and education, making applications to the REO for registration in the ITFC by those persons and inducing the latter to approve applications, so that they would be entitled to vote in the ITFC.With Li’s knowledge, Lui Ah-fook invited his three younger sisters to join an “IT Club” for $1,000 each, under a condition that the trio were required to register as voters and vote as instructed in the ITFC of above election (the scheme). Lui Wai-fong also extended the invitation to a co-defendant, who was her relative, while Lui King-yin mentioned the scheme with four co-defendants associated with him. Lui Ah-fook then forwarded the personal particulars of 36 persons to Li in the same month.As a result, about 127 persons, including Li, Yeung Yiu-hung, Poon, and the aforesaid 36 persons associated with the Luis, were registered as full members of the IEEE. Relevant membership fees were paid by Yeung Yiu-hung with his credit cards, which were subsequently settled by Li, mostly through cash deposits at automatic teller machines.Afterwards the REO received the voter registration forms of 124 persons. ICAC investigation discovered that they all carried the same typo. A total of 118 of them were included in the 2016 Final Register of Electors of the ITFC.Lui Wai-fong, Lui King-yin and Lui Wai-fong’s relative subsequently each collected $1,000 from Lui Ah-fook, while Lui King-yin paid each of his four associates $700 to $850.In addition, Li urged Yeung Yiu-hung, Lui Ah-fook and Lui Wai-fong to vote for Yeung Chuen-sing who competed in the ITFC at the election. Lui Wai-fong and Lui King-yin also made the same appeal to their associates on the polling day. Yeung Chuen-sing’s rival was elected at the end.The REO had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions David Chan and Acting Senior Public Prosecutor Dimitri Au Yeung, assisted by ICAC officer Oscar Lau.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1337.html

Skechers requested Wong to provide further details as no quotation from any contractor was enclosed.The court heard that the defendants had conspired together to defraud Skechers by submitting two quotations of Show Easy and Banner 1 to Skechers for the above project, and making false representation that the two quotations were genuinely competitive, obtained through a competitive process, and prepared separately from and independently of each other. In addition, Wong had recommended Show Easy to take up the project in view of its slightly lower bidding price.On December 20, 2017, Wong had also submitted to Skechers the printout of an email purportedly sent by Chan on behalf of Show Easy with the quotations of Show Easy attached.

His application was subsequently approved and pension totalling over $2.5 million was released to him.The remaining charge alleges that the defendant falsely represented to the Hong Kong Police Credit Union that he had not applied for loans from other banking or financial institutions, and with intent to defraud, induced the union to provide him a loan of over $80,000.The HKPF has rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1327.html
10/5/2022,IO chairman charged by ICAC admits forgery over Anti-epidemic Fund allowance,"The chairman of the incorporated owners (IO) of a building, charged by the ICAC, today (May 10) admitted at the Kowloon City Magistrates’ Courts that he had committed forgery and used copies of false instruments in relation to the applications for allowance for a security guard under the Anti-epidemic Fund.Tsui Chiu-cheung, 62, chairman of the IO of Comfort Court, pleaded guilty to two charges – one of forgery, contrary to Section 71 of the Crimes Ordinance; and one of using copies of false instruments, contrary to Section 74 of the Crimes Ordinance. The prosecution withdrew another forgery charge against him.Acting Principal Magistrate Ms Peony Wong Nga-yan adjourned the case to May 24 for sentence, pending the defendant’s community service order report. The defendant was granted cash bail.The court heard that in February 2020, the government launched the Anti-epidemic Support Scheme for Property Management Sector under the Anti-epidemic Fund to provide a monthly hardship allowance of $1,000 to security guards and cleaners working at eligible buildings, and a subsidy of $2,000 to every eligible building for procuring cleaning products.The Property Management Services Authority (PMSA) was responsible for processing applications made by owners’ organisations, including IOs, and property management companies, and arranging release of payments. After receiving payments, the applicant would distribute the allowance to the relevant security guards and cleaners who were required to acknowledge receipt of it.At the material time, the defendant was the chairman of the IO of Comfort Court. A security guard was employed by the IO.Between April and August 2020, the defendant submitted two applications to the PMSA for claiming allowance totalling $7,000 for the above security guard. Both applications were approved and the sum was deposited to the bank account of the IO.On November 19, 2020, the defendant submitted to the PMSA two receipts and copies of two other receipts purportedly signed by the security guard showing that the latter had acknowledged her receipt of the allowance of $7,000. However, ICAC inquiries revealed that the security guard had only received $3,000 and had never signed the above receipts.The defendant forged the signatures of the security guard on the receipts. He worried that the PMSA would request the IO to return the allowance of $7,000 if it was found that $4,000 out of the sum had not been paid to the security guard.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. The PMSA and the IO of Comfort Court had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by ICAC officer Jeff Ng.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1326.html

In November 2019, the defendant was assigned to handle a theft case involving a restaurant and interviewed the complainant of the case.On January 8, 2020, the defendant made a phone call to the complainant and asked for a $1 million loan. She had also sent mobile phone text messages to the complainant, offering to sign an “IOU” and repaying $20,000 together with an interest of $5,000 each month to the complainant. The request was turned down.The court also heard that in late August 2019, the defendant was assigned to conduct a cautioned interview with an arrestee of a fighting case. The case was closed in late September 2019 due to insufficient evidence. However, the defendant and the arrestee had maintained contacts thereafter.On May 8, 2020, the defendant told the arrestee that she was in need of money and solicited a loan of $60,000 from the latter. The defendant said she was willing to repay the arrestee with an interest of $20,000 within two weeks. The arrestee did not require the defendant to pay any interest and lent her $60,000 on May 11, 2020.The defendant had never sought any special permissions from the Chief Executive regarding her above solicitation and acceptance of loans.The ICAC investigation arose from a referral by the Police which had rendered full assistance to the Commission during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Public Prosecutor Antony Leung, assisted by ICAC officer Desmond Lee.An ICAC spokesperson noted that the ICAC attaches great importance to civil service integrity and has been working closely with the Police to provide integrity training and regular refresher courses to all new recruits and serving staff of the Police to heighten their awareness of corruption prevention, and to enhance their alertness to corruption, conflict of interest and other integrity challenges.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1324.html

The defendant was among six charged by the ICAC with bribery for assisting construction workers to secure employment with the sub-contractor.Tang Amanjo Ho-yin, 43, then site team leader of MLife Engineering Limited (MEL), was also ordered by Deputy Magistrate Mr Tsang Hing-tung to pay a restitution of $17,400, equivalent to the amount of illegal rebates concerned, to his then employer.The defendant was earlier found guilty of three charges – two of agent accepting an advantage, contrary to Section 9(1)(a) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO); and one of conspiracy for agent to accept advantages, contrary to Section 9(1)(a) of the POBO and Section 159A of the Crimes Ordinance.In sentencing, the deputy magistrate reprimanded the defendant for undermining the probity of Hong Kong society, warranting a deterrent custodial sentence.At the material time, MEL was a sub-contractor of the Third Runway Project responsible for recruiting construction workers to conduct various works. Recruitment was conducted mainly through referrals by construction workers. The defendant led a team of construction workers to perform carpentry works at the project’s construction site.The court heard that between June and August 2020, three construction workers were introduced by the defendant and others to work in the defendant’s team at the construction site. The defendant solicited an illegal rebate of $200 per working day from each of them.Between July 2020 and January 2021, the defendant accepted illegal rebates totalling $17,400 from the three construction workers.The three construction workers believed that they would not have been employed by MEL or would be terminated by the defendant if they had not given the rebates, the court heard.The investigation arose from corruption complaints filed with the ICAC. Following enforcement actions taken by the Commission, four then site team leaders, including the defendant, and two construction workers were charged with a total of 13 counts of bribery in three cases in October 2021.The Airport Authority Hong Kong, the relevant main contractor SAPR JV and MEL had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the cases.

5/5/2022,Four product testers charged by ICAC sentenced for wage fraud over false attendance,"Four then product testers of an electronic product manufacturer, charged by the ICAC, were today (May 5) sentenced at the Tuen Mun Magistrates’ Courts after admitting that they had overstated their working hours with intent to deceive their employers into releasing wages to them.After the four defendants entered guilty pleas, they were each sentenced by Principal Magistrate Mr Don So Man-lung to two months’ imprisonment, suspended for three years.Cheung Wing-sze and Tang Ho-yi, both 26 and then product testers employed by Nirotech Limited (NRT), pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law.Carol Leung Lai-fun, 43, then product tester employed by C.P.E. Human Resources Company (CPE) to work for NRT, pleaded guilty to one count of attempted fraud, contrary to Section 16A of the Theft Ordinance and Section 159G of the Crimes Ordinance.Lau Ho-lam, 21, another then product tester employed by CPE to work for NRT, pleaded guilty to one count of fraud, contrary to Section 16A of the Theft Ordinance.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. Upon completion of the investigation, the ICAC sought legal advice from the Department of Justice, which advised pressing the above charges against the four defendants.The court heard that the offences took place between February and July 2021. At the material time, the defendants were either directly employed by electronic product manufacturer NRT or supplied by CPE to work at NRT’s factory as night-shift product testers. The defendants were required to work nine hours for each working day from 10pm to 7am of the following day and were required to record their on and off duty time for wage calculation. Cheung and Tang were remunerated by NRT, while Leung and Lau were remunerated by CPE, which would then charge NRT the relevant service fees.The court heard that the defendants had shown up late to work and left the factory early on various occasions. Cheung and Tang had used a silicone molding tool to duplicate their fingerprints and used the molds to clock out at a fingerprint clocking machine for each other to falsely purport their off duty time. Meanwhile, Leung and Lau had reported on their attendance sheets that they had worked nine hours at the factory on all the working days concerned.By overstating their working hours by about 120 hours in total, the defendants obtained or attempted to obtain wages totalling about $7,000.Should NRT and CPE know that the attendance records submitted by the four defendants did not reflect their actual working hours, the two companies would not have released wages to them in accordance with the attendance records.NRT and CPE had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by ICAC officer Kevin Lam.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1323.html
4/5/2022,"ICAC continues to uphold Hong Kong’s probity, contribute to global anti-graft cause and partake in anti-epidemic work","ICAC Commissioner Simon Peh Yun-lu today (May 4) hosted a press conference to recount Hong Kong’s anti-corruption efforts in 2021 amid the Covid-19 epidemic  and update the media on the Commission’s major initiatives both locally and in the international arena this year. The press conference was originally scheduled for earlier this year but was postponed until today due to the epidemic situation.The ICAC received 2,264 non-election related corruption complaints in 2021, representing an increase of 18% over 2020, and remaining more or less the same as that in 2019. In the first three months of this year, the Commission received 391 corruption complaints, of which 321 were pursuable, representing a drop of 22% and 19% respectively.“In 2021, corruption remains well under control in Hong Kong. The surge in corruption complaints was mainly attributed to the increase in complaints concerning the private sector as the economic gradually picked up after the epidemic had eased off. As Hong Kong was badly hit by the fifth wave of the epidemic earlier this year, there was a drop in the overall corruption complaints received in the first quarter of 2022. That said, it is not suitable to make a year-on-year comparison based on statistics collected in only three months,” the Commissioner said.Mr Peh noted that apart from anti-corruption duties, ICAC officers had proactively assisted the government in its anti-epidemic work since the fifth wave of the epidemic. Several hundred ICAC staff members had taken turns to shoulder different duties, including contact-tracing, anti-epidemic supplies distribution, manning enquiry hotlines and assisting in organising the registration hotline and centre for Home Vaccination Service. They had exemplified the effectiveness, professionalism, resilience and team spirit of the Commission.In 2021, corruption complaints involving government bureaux/departments slightly rose by 3%, while those concerning public bodies went down by 15% when compared with 2020.The Commissioner noted that the civil service remained clean and honest. Following the establishment of the Civil Service College, the ICAC would take part in a number of training courses of the College to systematically introduce to civil servants of different ranks the anti-bribery law and other probity requirements. Newly elected legislators would be invited to visit the ICAC Headquarters to learn first-hand the work of the four departments.In addition, it is the ICAC’s duty to examine the systems and procedures of government departments and public bodies to assess and identify corruption risks. Mr Peh said: “The ICAC will keep abreast of the latest development and needs of the society and offer up-to-date corruption prevention advice, such as leveraging technology to enhance public service efficiency, streamline procedures as well as provide more effective monitoring measures,”The ICAC had also launched an integrity promotion campaign for public bodies to encourage them to put in place integrity management systems. At the same time, the Commission will partner with professional bodies to strengthen their integrity management and graft prevention capability.Meanwhile, corruption complaints concerning the private sector registered an increase of 31% last year. Among different sectors, building management, construction industry, and finance and insurance attracted most complaints.For the building management sector, the ICAC had been working closely with the Property Management Services Authority to strengthen its internal controls in various areas, such as licensing and complaints handling. The Commission had also produced a training video and self-learning kit for industry practitioners to enhance their ethical standard.2021 saw a surge in corruption complaints in relation to employment-related matters involving construction workers, rising from 14 in 2020 to 70 last year. The ICAC had joined hands with the Construction Industry Council and relevant government departments to raise corruption prevention awareness in the industry and enhance corruption prevention measures in workers recruitment. Components of the “Integrity Management System” promulgated by the ICAC for the construction sector were included among the registration requirements for public works contractors. Over 190 construction companies had so far joined the “Integrity Charter” launched by the Commission.Following the introduction of the new regulatory regime in the insurance industry, the ICAC had launched a Corruption Prevention Guide for Insurance Companies. The Commission will also roll out an Ethics Promotion Programme for Banking Industry to enhance professional ethics of banking practitioners and promote a probity culture across the industry.As at the end of 2021, the ICAC received eight complaints regarding the Election Committee Subsector Elections and 52 in relation to the Legislative Council General Election held last year. For the Chief Executive Election to be held this Sunday (May 8), the ICAC had provided holistic educational services to candidates, elections helpers and Election Committee members. ICAC officers will also be deployed to observe the polling and the vote-counting procedures.The ICAC had strived to nurture positive values among young people. The newly launched i-PLUS youth development project aimed to enhance secondary and tertiary school students’ law-abidingness and knowledge in local anti-corruption work. The Commission held the first leadership training camp for secondary school students last year, and the programme will be extended to tertiary students this summer.On the international anti-graft front, since Commissioner Peh was elected President of the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities (IAACA) in January this year, the ICAC has taken over the work of IAACA Secretariat, reflecting the recognition of Hong Kong’s anti-graft work by the international community and the Commission’s increasing importance in the global arena. Peh noted that following his assumption of IAACA presidency, the Association had immediately adopted the global regions cooperation and coordination mechanism advocated by the ICAC so as to strengthen regional cooperation and put forward anti-corruption agencies (ACAs)’ capacity building.The IAACA is an independent, non-political anti-corruption organisation instrumental to promoting the effective implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), and assisting ACAs worldwide in preventing and fighting against corruption. Under the UNCAC, the ICAC has been designated by the Central Government since 2006 to assist other state parties in developing and implementing corruption prevention measures.In the past five years, the ICAC had built rapport with 63 UNCAC state parties for anti-corruption training. Over 30 capacity building programmes were hosted for overseas ACAs, benefiting over 1,000 anti-graft fighters worldwide.This year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The ICAC will launch an array of activities to enhance the public’s understanding of Hong Kong’s probity situation and the Commission’s work. Among them will be a three-day “Journey for Integrity” experiential programme to take place in June at Tai Kwun, Central. Participants will learn more about the evils of corruption and the rule of law by taking a walk down memory lane of Hong Kong’s anti-corruption history. Members of the public can also visit various ICAC facilitates and attend briefing by ICAC officers during the ICAC Open Day scheduled for this summer.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1322.html
4/5/2022,Man charged by ICAC sentenced for breaching ECICO by inciting others to cast invalid votes at LegCo Election,"A man, charged by the ICAC, was today (May 4) sentenced to two months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years, at the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts for displaying two posts on his social media page and shared them on other social media pages to incite others to cast invalid votes at the 2021 Legislative Council General Election (LegCo Election) during the election period.Victor Chou Wing-tat, 57, working in the garment industry, earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of engaging in illegal conduct to incite another person not to vote, or to cast invalid vote, by activity in public during election period, contrary to Section 27A(1) of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance (ECICO).In sentencing, Magistrate Mr Cheng Lim-chi said the offences committed by the defendant were election-related and serious in nature. The magistrate said he took a starting point of three months’ imprisonment and reduced the defendant’s jail term to two months in view of his guilty plea. Having considered the defendant’s background and frank admission of his wrongdoings, a suspended sentence was meted out.The court heard that the LegCo Election was open for nominations from October 30, 2021. According to the ECICO, the period between that day and the polling day (December 19, 2021) was defined as the “election period” of the election.On October 30, 2021, which was the first day of the nomination period, the ICAC published a press statement on its official website to remind members of the public that inciting others not to vote or to cast invalid votes by activities in public during the election period would be in breach of Section 27A of the ECICO.On November 2, 2021, the defendant displayed a post on his social media page and shared it to six social media pages to incite viewers to cast invalid votes at the LegCo Election. The post was displayed on his social media page and the above six pages during the election period.On the morning of the polling day, the defendant displayed another post on his social media page and shared it to four social media pages to incite viewers to cast invalid votes at the LegCo Election.The ECICO stipulates that “activity in public” includes any form of communication to the public, and the distribution or dissemination of any matter to the public. The ECICO applies to all conduct concerning an election, whether the conduct is engaged in within Hong Kong or elsewhere.The ICAC had earlier conducted investigations into online posts which incited others to cast blank votes or invalid votes at the LegCo Election. In accordance with established procedures, the findings of the investigation were forwarded to the Department of Justice (DoJ) for legal advice. Upon legal advice of the DoJ, the defendant was charged on February 11, 2022.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Public Prosecutor Antony Leung, assisted by ICAC officer Wincy Lai.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1320.html
4/5/2022,Ex-employee of HyD subcontractor charged by ICAC jailed for fraud over false road inspection reports,"A former employee of a subcontractor of the Highways Department (HyD), charged by the ICAC, was today (May 4) sentenced to six months’ imprisonment at the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts for conspiracy to defraud the HyD by submitting road inspection reports containing photographs with falsely altered dates.Chui Ka-kin, 42, former assistant to network manager of Wah Fung Engineering Company Limited (Wah Fung), was earlier found guilty of five counts of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law.In sentencing, Deputy Magistrate Mr Gary Chu Man-hon said the HyD was unable to identify roads that required maintenance because of the fraudulent acts committed by the defendant. As the offences were serious in nature and affected road safety, the court must handle the case seriously and considered that non-custodial sentence was inappropriate.The case arose from a corruption complaint referred by the HyD. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the above offences.The court heard that in 2017, the HyD awarded a term contract concerning management and maintenance of the roads on Hong Kong Island (excluding high speed roads) to Chiu Hing Construction and Transportation Company Limited (Chiu Hing), which then subcontracted the relevant works to Wah Fung.Under the contract, Chiu Hing was required to deploy road inspectors to conduct regular road inspections on Hong Kong Island and prepare reports supported by real-time photographs of the roads taken during the inspections.At the material time, the defendant was employed by Wah Fung as an assistant to network manager to support a network manager of Chiu Hing in overseeing the contract. Assistant road inspectors of Wah Fung were assigned to carry out inspections and prepare reports under the supervision of the defendant and the network manager of Chiu Hing.As Wah Fung did not have sufficient manpower to complete about 4,000 outstanding road inspection reports before the submission deadline set on June 30, 2017, the defendant and the network manager of Chiu Hing instructed six assistant road inspectors of Wah Fung at various meetings held between May 8 and June 30, 2017 to fraudulently prepare about 300 reports by using photographs of roads which were not taken on the dates of the road inspections as support.The court heard that the reports supported by photographs with dates falsely altered by the six assistant road inspectors of Wah Fung were then submitted to the HyD.Between September 1 and October 31, 2017, the defendant also instructed four of the assistant road inspectors of Wah Fung to use photographs taken for previous road inspection reports to fraudulently prepare at least 27 other reports and submitted them to the HyD.Had the HyD known that the road inspection reports contained any false information, the department would not have accepted them as it would result in compromising road safety and releasing unwarranted payments to Chiu Hing.The six assistant road inspectors of Wah Fung were earlier charged by the ICAC with one count of conspiracy to defraud in a separate case. They pleaded guilty to the charge and were each sentenced to a 12-month probation order.The HyD had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Eddie Sean, assisted by ICAC officer Hugh Tan.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1321.html

For the purpose of calculating the relevant signing fee, she submitted her commission account statements in relation to another insurance company for the period between June 2013 and May 2015 to AIA.Based on the commission account statements which purportedly showed that the defendant’s total income during the above period was about $2.2 million, AIA approved to grant her a signing fee of over $860,000 and released the sum to her when she joined the company in August 2015.However, ICAC inquiries revealed that the defendant’s total income during the period was about $650,000 and she was only entitled to receive a signing fee of about $100,000. By exaggerating the total income by over $1.5 million, the defendant was granted a signing fee $760,000 higher than her entitlement.Had AIA known the commission account statements were false, the company would not have employed the defendant.The case arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the above offence. AIA had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Alice Chan, assisted by ICAC officer Teresa Cheung.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1315.html

Lee Shing obtained from Hip Hing a masonry contract worth about $60 million of a private construction project in 2020, and further bid for two masonry contracts worth totalling about $250 million of the Kai Tak Sports Park project in 2021.Ng was a senior manager of Hip Hing in charge of the site services support of the construction sites managed by Hip Hing.

26/4/2022,Duo charged by ICAC guilty of fraud over $23m hotel redevelopment project,"A director of a consultancy firm and a director of an engineering company, charged by the ICAC, were convicted at the District Court today (April 26) of conspiracy to defraud by inducing a project developer to award to the duo’s companies a plumbing and drainage installation contract of a hotel redevelopment project in Mongkok worth over $23 million.Wong Wing-chau, 67, director of Saneseed Limited (Saneseed); and Ma Sau-kam, 60, director of Panocean Engineering Limited (Panocean), were found guilty of a joint charge of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law.Deputy Judge Ms Katherine Lo Kit-yee adjourned the case to June 1 for sentence. The defendants were remanded in the custody of the Correctional Services Department.The court heard that at the material time, Wong was the sole director and shareholder of Saneseed, an electrical and mechanical consultant. Wong’s son and Ma were both directors and shareholders of Panocean, an engineering company. Meanwhile, Ma was also an employee of Gloryfield Engineering Limited (Gloryfield), another company of Wong which shared Saneseed’s office.Champion Success Limited (Champion) was the project developer of a hotel redevelopment project in Mongkok. In March 2011, Champion named Saneseed as an electrical and mechanical consultant of the project to provide consultancy service covering fire services installation, electrical installation, mechanical ventilation and air conditioning installation, as well as plumbing and drainage installation (the four areas).Saneseed was required to assist Champion in drawing up a tender list for the four areas and choosing a suitable contractor. Saneseed would also supervise and monitor the relevant works conducted.Panocean was one of the contractors recommended by Wong to submit tenders for the works on the four areas. The total bidding price quoted by Panocean, which amounted to over $103 million, was above the lowest three bids. But Champion still considered Panocean’s bid and invited it to attend the relevant tender interviews as Wong highly recommended Panocean.Upon the arrangement by the defendants, two “managers” of Panocean attended the tender interviews hosted by Wong and representatives of Champion. Champion subsequently awarded the plumbing and drainage installation contract to Panocean at over $23 million in August 2014.After obtaining the plumbing and drainage installation contract, Panocean subcontracted the relevant works to other companies without the permission of Champion.The court heard that Wong had never declared to Champion that his son was a director of Panocean nor had he declared to Champion his own interests in and relationship with Panocean. Wong had also induced Champion to award the contract to Panocean by fraudulent means. Should Champion know Wong’s interests in and relationship with Panocean, it would not have invited Panocean to submit tenders or awarded the contract to Panocean.ICAC inquires revealed that Panocean had no employee. An employee of Gloryfield and a business partner of Wong attended the above tender interviews as “managers” of Panocean. All tendering documents of Panocean were prepared and submitted to Champion by Ma upon Wong’s instructions.The case arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the above offence. Champion had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Susanna Ku, assisted by ICAC officer Billy Cheng.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1310.html
25/4/2022,Trio charged by ICAC admit illegal conduct of incurring election expenses at 2016 LegCo Election,"Three persons, who were neither candidates nor election expense agents of any candidates of the 2016 Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election (the Election), charged by the ICAC, today (April 25) admitted at the District Court that they had engaged in illegal conduct at the election by incurring election expenses totalling over $253,000 for placing six advertisements in two newspapers.Tai Yiu-ting, 57, pleaded guilty to four counts of engaging in illegal conduct at an election by incurring election expense, contrary to Section 23(1) of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance (ECICO). Sentencing was adjourned to May 24.Co-defendants Ip Kim-ching, 56, and Sek Sau-ching, 51, jointly faced the above four charges with Tai. Their lawyers made representations to dispose of their case by way of bind over orders. After considering the relevant factors, including the overall circumstances of the case, the relatively lesser criminalities of Ip and Sek, their backgrounds and their attitudes towards the charges, the Department of Justice (DoJ) agreed to deal with their case by way of bind over procedure and offered no evidence to the charges against the duo.Judge Mr Anthony Kwok Kai-on imposed a 12-month bind over order at $40,000 each on Ip and Sek after they admitted in court the summary of facts of the case and gave an undertaking to the court to be of good behaviour, keep the peace and not to breach election-related offences for a period of 12 months.An ICAC spokesperson reminds members of the public that only a candidate or a person authorised in writing by a candidate as his election expense agent can incur election expenses.Section 23(1) of the ECICO stipulates that it is an illegal conduct for a person, other than a candidate or a candidate’s election expense agent, to incur election expenses at or in connection with the election. Any expenditure incurred for promoting or prejudicing the election of a particular candidate or particular candidates should be counted as election expenses.The court heard that the Election was held on September 4, 2016. On various occasions before the Election, Tai, via a radio programme, press conferences and social media, introduced to voters a voting scheme with a goal for taking half the seats in the LegCo by particular groups through recruiting voters to cast their votes for particular candidates based on recommendations to be provided by the scheme.On August 9, 2016, a half-page advertisement promoting the scheme and its goal was placed in both Ming Pao Daily News (Ming Pao) and Apple Daily. A full-page advertisement urging voters to cast their votes with information provided by the scheme was also placed in the two newspapers on September 2 and 4, 2016.Advertisement fees totalling over $253,000 for the above six advertisements, respectively $133,540 for the three advertisements placed in Ming Pao and $120,000 for another three advertisements placed in Apple Daily, were settled by Eggs Alliance Company Limited (Eggs Alliance). Ip and Sek were both directors of Eggs Alliance and authorised signatories of its bank accounts.The court heard that none of the candidates being promoted under the scheme had included or set out the advertisement fees in their election returns. Tai, Ip and Sek were not candidates or election expense agents of any candidates of the Election.The ICAC investigation arose from a complaint alleging breaches of the ECICO. Upon legal advice sought from the DoJ, charges were preferred against the trio. The Registration and Electoral Office had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Alice Chan, assisted by ICAC officer Stephen Leung.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1307.html

Recruitment was conducted mainly through referrals by construction workers. The defendant led a team of construction workers to perform carpentry works at the project’s construction site.The court heard that between June and August 2020, three construction workers were introduced by the defendant and others to work in the defendant’s team at the construction site. The defendant solicited an illegal rebate of $200 per working day from each of them.Between July 2020 and January 2021, the defendant accepted illegal rebates totalling $17,400 from the three construction workers.The three construction workers believed that they would not have been employed by MEL or would be terminated by the defendant if they had not given the rebates, the court heard.The investigation arose from corruption complaints filed with the ICAC. Following enforcement actions taken by the Commission, four then site team leaders, including the defendant, and two construction workers were charged with a total of 13 counts of bribery in three cases in October 2021.The Airport Authority Hong Kong, the relevant main contractor SAPR JV and MEL had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the cases. ICAC enquiries are continuing and further arrests and prosecutions may be made.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Stephen Fong, assisted by ICAC officers Eric Siu and Cody Chung.Construction workers are reminded that “customary practice” in an industry is not an excuse for bribery. They should not accede to pay illegal rebate and should report the matter to the ICAC immediately if they encounter any solicitation.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1308.html

The defendants were remanded in the custody of the Correctional Services Department.CRCL is a subsidiary of publicly listed China Railway Construction Corporation Limited (CRCC). China Railway International Trading (HK) Limited (CRITL) is another wholly owned subsidiary of CRCC, which is run by staff members of CRCL to source construction materials for CRCL and its associated companies.The court heard that at the material time, Wang was a deputy general manager of CRCL responsible for business development, while Lau was a director of TFCL.In September 2016, Wang arranged TFCL and CRCL to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to form joint ventures to take up certain construction projects. Afterwards, TFCL requested CRCL to assist in financing its purchase of materials and CRCL agreed.In December 2016, Wang arranged TFCL to further enter into three trade agreements with CRITL whereby CRITL would act as TFCL’s purchasing agent for procuring construction materials from a supplier for three construction projects, and payments would be settled by L/Cs granted by DBS Bank Limited (DBS Bank) to CRCL.In January 2017, CRITL submitted three applications to DBS Bank for issuing three L/Cs in favour of the above supplier. Between January and March 2017, Lau had produced documents, including invoices of construction materials, packing lists and cargo receipts to support the relevant procurements. As a result, DBS Bank approved all of the applications and released three L/Cs payments totalling HK$75.3 million to the supplier.ICAC inquiries revealed that there was no such trade transaction. Wang arranged signing of the MOU and the three trade agreements to procure granting of the above L/Cs. The supporting documents produced by Lau were false documents and he had dealt with proceeds totalling HK$10.5 million arising from the scam.CRCC, CRCL, CRITL and DBS Bank had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Derek Chan SC and prosecuting counsel Olivia Tsang, assisted by ICAC officers Raymond Yung and Eddie Chu.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1306.html

Three other theft charges against the defendant were left on file at the District Court.In sentencing, Judge Frankie Yiu Fun-che said bribery and theft are both serious offences, warranting an immediate custodial sentence. The judge also ordered the defendant to pay $25,000, being the unreturned bribe, as restitution to Capital Mark.At the material time, Capital Mark was the operator of the wet market of Sunshine City Plaza in Ma On Shan. The defendant was a market manager responsible for the daily operation of the wet market, including handling tenancy matters and collecting rents from tenants. If a tenant failed to pay rents on or before the due date, the defendant was required to collect the accrued interest from the latter.In September 2018 and January 2019, the defendant respectively accepted $9,000 and $25,000 from an electrician and a restaurant operator for referring the electrician to sublease a stall and referring another stall to the restaurant operator. The defendant subsequently returned the bribe of $9,000 to the electrician.The court heard that Capital Mark did not allow the defendant to solicit or accept advantages from tenants in relation to tenancy matters of the market.On 10 occasions between December 2017 and June 2019, the defendant requested another restaurant operator and a fish stall owner to settle the rent and accrued interest owed by their stalls to Capital Mark. He collected 10 cheques in the total sum of over $130,000 from the two tenants, but Capital Mark had never received those rents or interest payments.ICAC enquiries revealed that nine of the cheques were eventually deposited into the personal bank accounts of the defendant and the remaining cheque was deposited into a bank account of a friend of the defendant.The court also heard that between June and November 2019, the defendant further collected cash totalling $390,000 from a fruit stall owner as rent and rental arrears to Capital Mark. However, Capital Mark only received $367,000, and the remaining sum of about $23,000 had never been deposited into its bank account.Capital Market has rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Public Prosecutor Marcus Lee, assisted by ICAC officer Patrick Yu.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1305.html

According to the policy of the company, the defendant would receive an overriding commission for any property transaction procured by a subordinate, while the subordinate would receive a sales commission in relation to the transaction.Centaline Property prohibited branch managers from soliciting or accepting any advantages from their subordinates for arranging them to handle or assisting them in handling property transactions procured by branch managers.The charges allege that between January 9, 2018 and February 16, 2019, the defendant conspired together with a subordinate for the defendant to, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, accept two bribes totalling over $37,000 from the subordinate as an inducement to or reward for the defendant to represent to Centaline Property that the subordinate was a negotiator in the sale and purchase transactions of two private residential properties in Tuen Mun.ICAC inquiries revealed that the subordinate had no involvement in procuring the two transactions. Centaline Property released about $45,000 in overriding commission and about $91,000 in sales commission to the defendant and the subordinate respectively in relation to the two transactions. It is alleged that the defendant had subsequently accepted the two bribes totalling over $37,000 from the subordinate.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint.

20/4/2022,Trio charged by ICAC over $8m mortgage loan fraud by understating property purchase price,"The ICAC yesterday (April 19) charged a property buyer and two estate agents with conspiracy to defraud by falsely understating that the purchase price of a residential property in Shatin was only $10 million so as to obtain a bank mortgage loan with an 80 per cent loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which amounted to $8 million.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. Upon completion of the investigation, the ICAC sought legal advice from the Department of Justice, which advised pressing charges against the trio.Timothy Lau Tin-yuen, 38, employee of an insurance company; Ho Tung-hung, 40, and Wong Man-yin, 37, both property agents of Festival Home Property Agency Limited (Festival Home); jointly face one count of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law.Lau alone further faces one count of fraud, contrary to Section 16A of the Theft Ordinance.The defendants were released on ICAC bail, pending their appearance in the Shatin Magistrates’ Courts tomorrow (April 21) for plea.The alleged offences took place between January and March 2020. At the material time, Lau was a prospective buyer of a residential property in Shatin. Ho and Wong, both property agents of Festival Home, were requested by Lau to negotiate the purchase price with the vendor.According to the guidelines issued by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, banks are required to comply with the LTV ratio requirement for property mortgage lending. Under mortgage insurance programmes, a purchaser could obtain a mortgage loan of up to an 80 per cent LTV ratio from a bank if the purchase price of the above property did not exceed $10 million. If the purchase price was above $10 million, the maximum LTV ratio would be 50 per cent of the purchase price.One of the charges alleges that the three defendants conspired together with the vendor of the above property to defraud banks which would offer property mortgage loans by dishonestly falsely representing that the purchase price of the above property was $10 million while the actual price was $10.5 million; and causing the banks to grant mortgage loan facilities with an 80 per cent LTV ratio to Lau for purchasing the property.ICAC enquiries revealed that Lau had allegedly paid the remaining purchase price of the property of $500,000 in cash to the vendor. He made two applications for mortgage loans with 80 per cent LTV with two banks.

19/4/2022,Ex-employee of HyD subcontractor charged by ICAC guilty of fraud over false road inspection reports,"A former employee of a subcontractor of the Highways Department (HyD), charged by the ICAC, was today (April 19) convicted at the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts of conspiracy to defraud the HyD by submitting road inspection reports containing photographs with falsely altered dates.Chui Ka-kin, 42, former assistant to network manager of Wah Fung Engineering Company Limited (Wah Fung), was found guilty of five counts of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law.Deputy Magistrate Mr Gary Chu Man-hon adjourned the case to May 4 for sentence, pending the defendant’s background and community service order reports. The defendant was granted cash bail.The case arose from a corruption complaint referred by the HyD. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the above offences.The court heard that in 2017, the HyD awarded a term contract concerning management and maintenance of the roads on Hong Kong Island (excluding high speed roads) to Chiu Hing Construction and Transportation Company Limited (Chiu Hing), which then subcontracted the relevant works to Wah Fung.Under the contract, Chiu Hing was required to deploy road inspectors to conduct regular road inspections on Hong Kong Island and prepare reports supported by real-time photographs of the roads taken during the inspections.At the material time, the defendant was employed by Wah Fung as an assistant to network manager to support a network manager of Chiu Hing in overseeing the contract. Assistant road inspectors of Wah Fung were assigned to carry out inspections and prepare reports under the supervision of the defendant and the network manager of Chiu Hing.As Wah Fung did not have sufficient manpower to complete about 4,000 outstanding road inspection reports before the submission deadline set on June 30, 2017, the defendant and the network manager of Chiu Hing instructed six assistant road inspectors of Wah Fung at various meetings held between May 8 and June 30, 2017 to fraudulently prepare about 300 reports by using photographs of roads which were not taken on the dates of the road inspections as support.The court heard that the reports supported by photographs with dates falsely altered by the six assistant road inspectors of Wah Fung were then submitted to the HyD.Between September 1 and October 31, 2017, the defendant also instructed four of the assistant road inspectors of Wah Fung to use photographs taken for previous road inspection reports to fraudulently prepare at least 27 other reports and submitted them to the HyD.Had the HyD known that the road inspection reports contained any false information, the department would not have accepted them as it would result in compromising road safety and releasing unwarranted payments to Chiu Hing.The six assistant road inspectors of Wah Fung were earlier charged by the ICAC with one count of conspiracy to defraud in a separate case. They pleaded guilty to the charge and were each sentenced to a 12-month probation order.The HyD had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Eddie Sean, assisted by ICAC officer Hugh Tan.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1301.html

He told his team members at weekly meetings that in order to maximise the commissions receivable by the whole team, arrangements would be made for the lowest ranking staff in the team to receive commissions from the company apart from receiving basic monthly salaries. The relevant commissions received by those staff should be passed to the defendant for handling.Between September and November 2017, Sun Life HK received eight insurance applications in which two down-line agents of the defendant were named as the handling agents. Believing that the information in the relevant application forms were genuine, Sun Life HK approved those applications and granted commissions in relation to the eight policies to the two down-line agents.Between October 2017 and January 2018, the defendant instructed the two down-line agents to return the commissions to him in five sums of cash, each ranged from $38,000 to $267,000, totalling over $640,000.ICAC enquiries revealed that the two down-line agents did not take part in the sale process of the eight policies concerned.

22/3/2022,Man jailed for three years for bribery over public park construction after absconding for 25 years,"A former employee of a sub-contractor of a public park construction project, who had absconded for over 25 years after being charged by the ICAC in late 1994, was today (March 22) sentenced to three years’ imprisonment after admitting at the District Court that he had offered bribes totalling $67,000 to two government officers over lax supervision.Ng Yip-wan, 93, former site agent of now-defunct Siffa Engineering Limited (Siffa), pleaded guilty to seven counts of offering an advantage to a public servant, contrary to Section 4(1)(a) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance. Two counts of conspiracy to offer an advantage to a public servant against the defendant were left on file at the District Court.In passing the sentence, Judge Mr Isaac Tam Sze-lok said the community had the expectation that corruption be stamped out and one case of such crime would be too much.  Hence, a deterrent custodial sentence was inevitable.The defendant was charged by the ICAC with the above offences in November 1994. After he failed to appear at the District Court for trial on September 11, 1995, a warrant for his arrest was issued. He was arrested by ICAC officers and brought to the court in April 2021 after returning to Hong Kong from the Mainland.The court heard that at the material time, then Territory Development Department (TDD) - which merged with then Civil Engineering Department to become the Civil Engineering and Development Department in 2004 - was responsible for the overall management of the Tsing Yi Park construction project.In August 1993, Siffa entered into two sub-contracts with the project’s main contractor to undertake the construction and site management works of the Tsing Yi Park. The defendant was a site agent of Siffa responsible for overseeing the works of Siffa at the construction site.An Inspector of Works and a Works Supervisor of the TDD were responsible for inspecting the works carried out by Siffa at the construction site, and performing tests on the materials used by Siffa in accordance with the relevant specifications and requirements.In early February 1994, the TDD Inspector of Works solicited bribe payments from the defendant in return for not questioning the standard and quality of the works carried out by Siffa at the Tsing Yi Park construction site. Between February and July 1994, the defendant paid a monthly bribe of $10,000, totalling $60,000, to the TDD Inspector of Works.In May 1994, the TDD Works Supervisor found that part of the works conducted by Siffa were not up to standard but the TDD Inspector of Works had taken a lax attitude towards the situation.Subsequently on September 1, 1994, the defendant handed over $7,000 in cash to the TDD Works Supervisor in return for the latter to carry out lax inspections of the works of Siffa at the Tsing Yi Park construction site. The defendant was arrested by ICAC officers on the same day.The TDD had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Public Prosecutor Antony Leung, assisted by ICAC officer Michelle Leung.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1290.html
17/3/2022,"Two former insurance agents charged by ICAC jailed for $750,000 commission fraud","Two former insurance agents, charged by the ICAC, were today (March 17) respectively jailed for 37 months and 12 months for conspiracy to defraud an insurance company of commissions totalling over $750,000 by falsely representing that one of them had handled 10 insurance policies.Tin Tak-ho, 47, former senior branch manager of Manulife (International) Limited (Manulife), was sentenced to 37 months’ imprisonment, while Alvin Tam Man-chan, 56, former insurance agent of Manulife, received a jail term of 12 months.The duo pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law. Tin earlier further pleaded guilty to five counts of forgery, contrary to Section 71 of the Crimes Ordinance.In sentencing, District Court Judge Mr Isaac Tam Sze-lok said the court had to impose deterrent custodial sentences on the defendants as the duo had breached the trust placed on them and caused financial loss to the insurer concerned.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent enquiries revealed the above offences.The court heard that at the material time, Tin was a senior branch manager of Manulife and Tam was his down-line agent. When an insurance product of Manulife was sold, the handling agent would receive a commission while his up-line managers would receive overriding commissions and/or bonuses from Manulife.In December 2017, Manulife received 10 insurance policy application forms submitted by Tin. The application forms were purportedly signed by nine persons as applicants and Tam as the handling agent. Manulife subsequently released commissions totalling over $470,000 to Tam as the handling agent, and overriding commissions totalling about $280,000 to Tin in respect of those insurance policies.ICAC inquiries revealed that the duo had reached an agreement for Tam to falsely represent as the handling agent of insurance policy applications handled by Tin. Tam did not procure the 10 insurance policies or meet the applicants concerned. The relevant initial premiums were arranged by Tin to pay to Manulife and Tam returned the commissions received from the company to Tin.Had Manulife known that the 10 application forms contained false information, it would not underwrote and issued the insurance policies, nor would it paid the commissions and overriding commissions to Tam and Tin respectively.Five of the relevant applicants confirmed that they had not applied for the insurance policies concerned and it was revealed that the relevant application forms were forged by Tin without their knowledge.Manulife had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Public Prosecutor Paggie Lee, assisted by ICAC officers Jeff Chow and Romeo Chu.Over the years, the ICAC has been actively providing corruption prevention services to insurance organisations and arranging ethics training for practitioners.

16/3/2022,Duo charged by ICAC with conspiracy to defraud Lands Department over Yuen Long small house estate development project,"Following enforcement actions taken by the ICAC earlier against suspected corruption and fraud in relation to a small house estate development project in Yuen Long, the Commission this morning (March 16) charged the operator of a small house developer and a village representative in Yuen Long for allegedly conspiring with others to deceive the Lands Department into granting various building licenses for the project in a span of 14 years.Edward Wong Kwong-wing, 72, operator of Wing Smart Construction Limited (Wing Smart), and Ching Chan-ming, 65, indigenous inhabitant representative of Shui Tsiu San Tsuen, jointly face one count of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to the Common Law. They will be brought to the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts today for mention.The investigation arose from corruption complaints filed with the ICAC. Wong and Ching were charged at this stage after seeking legal advice from the Department of Justice. As the relevant corruption investigation is continuing, the ICAC does not rule out further law enforcement actions.Shui Tsiu San Tsuen is a village in Yuen Long. Under the New Territories Small House Policy (“the Policy”), every male indigenous inhabitant of the village aged 18 or above may exercise his “Ding Right” once and apply to the Lands Department to build a small house at the village for his own occupation. “Ding Right” is not transferrable.ICAC enquiries revealed that Ching, an indigenous inhabitant representative of Shui Tsiu San Tsuen, started the development of a small house estate project in Shui Tsiu San Tsuen by purchasing “Ding Rights” from indigenous inhabitants in Yuen Long in around 1996. Later in about March 2005, Wing Smart, controlled by Wong, entered into an agreement with Ching and appointed him as its trustee to jointly develop the small house project. Ching then continued to purchase more “Ding Rights” from indigenous inhabitants and arranged for them to apply for building licences to build small houses in Shui Tsiu San Tsuen.The charge alleges that between May 2005 and May 2019, Wong and Ching conspired together and with other persons to defraud the Lands Department by making false representations to induce the Director of Lands and his officers to act contrary to their public duty, namely to grant building licences to applicants who applied for building licences to build small houses under the Policy.They had allegedly falsely represented that each of the above applicants was the sole legal and registered owner of the respective lot of land located at Shui Tsiu San Tsuen, in respect of which they were applying for building licences.It is also alleged that they had falsely represented that the applicants had never entered into any agreement or arrangements with any person(s) to transfer or otherwise deal with their respective lots of land or any interest therein; and the applicants had never made and had no intention of making any private arrangements for their rights under the Policy to be sold to other individual or a developer.ICAC investigation revealed that during the above period, a number of small houses were built in Shui Tsiu San Tsuen and sold to members of the public at the market price ranging from $9 to $13 million each under the name of a private estate. As a result, Wing Smart received over $1,000 million for the sale of 115 small houses in the private estate.The Lands Department has offered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1288.html

The defendant was only required to sign on documents for making loan applications while WICL’s accounting and administrative matters were handled by a female associate of the de facto owner and a clerk of the company.Acting on the instructions of WICL’s de facto owner, the defendant made various applications for credit facilities and loans with four banks, namely Citibank (Hong Kong) Limited, Dah Sing Bank Limited, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited and The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.The defendant admitted that he had conspired with the de facto owner, his female associate and the clerk (the trio) to submit false supporting documents, including bank statements, auditor’s reports, as well as invoices, delivery notes and packing lists purportedly in relation to transactions between WICL and its seven suppliers to defraud the above four banks.As a result, the four banks were caused to grant banking facilities totalling $31 million and 83 loans totalling over $102 million to WICL, and to release the over $102 million directly to the seven suppliers concerned. ICAC enquiries revealed that the sums released to the seven suppliers were subsequently distributed to various bank accounts held by WICL and the trio.The defendant also admitted having conspired with the trio to defraud the TID and the HKMC by falsely representing that all the information contained in five application forms for the SGS and the SpGS and two application forms for the SFGS was true, accurate and complete.As a result, the TID was caused to issue five guarantees in favour of three of the above banks and to act as the guarantor for various types of loans and facilities totalling $7 million granted by the three banks to WICL.Meanwhile, the HKMC was caused to issue two guarantees in favour of one of the four banks and to act as the guarantor for a term loan and an overdraft facility totalling $4 million granted by the bank to WICL.The TID, the HKMC and the four banks concerned had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Public Prosecutor Paggie Lee, assisted by ICAC officer Gary Li.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1287.html

The defendant was remanded in the custody of the Correctional Services Department.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent enquiries revealed the above offences.The court heard that Sun Life HK was a licensed insurer in Hong Kong. When an insurance product was sold, the company would release commissions and overriding commissions respectively to the handling agent and his/her up-line managers.At the material time, the defendant was a senior unit manager of Sun Life HK. He told his team members at weekly meetings that in order to maximise the commissions receivable by the whole team, arrangements would be made for the lowest ranking staff in the team to receive commissions from the company apart from receiving basic monthly salaries.

A co-defendant is charged with conspiracy to deal with crime proceeds totalling about HK$55 million.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. Upon completion of the investigation, the ICAC sought legal advice from the Department of Justice, which advised pressing a total of eight charges against the defendants.Four of the defendants, Woo Man-ho, 34; Chan Tak-ching, 34; and Leung Ho-yin, 35, all former relationship managers of Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited (Standard Chartered Bank); and Law Man-fai, 48, self-employed financial consultant; face seven counts of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law.Co-defendant Catherine Kum Kit-ching, 53, manager of ADF Capital Limited (ADF), faces one count of conspiracy to deal with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence, contrary to Section 25(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance and Section 159A of the Crimes Ordinance.All defendants were released on ICAC bail, pending their court appearance in the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts on Thursday (January 27) for mention.At the material time, Woo, Chan and Leung were relationship managers of Standard Chartered Bank. The bank would issue documents to confirm the balance of a client’s account held with the bank upon request, but the trio were not authorised to sign and issue those documents. Kum was a manager of ADF which held accounts with Standard Chartered Bank, while Law was a self-employed financial consultant.The alleged offences took place between January 2015 and January 2019. During the period, the defendants had allegedly conspired with four foreign nationals to defraud various Japanese investors to invest in ADF and a number of companies by using false documents, namely proof of fund letters and corporate refund promissory notes (CRPNs), purportedly issued by Standard Chartered Bank and signed by Woo and Chan.The four foreign nationals involved were a Zambian man and a Korean man, both shareholders-cum-directors of ADF; a Thai man, an account holder of Standard Chartered Bank and Chan’s client; and a Japanese woman, who was a company director.Four of the charges allege that Woo conspired with Chan, Law, the Thai man, the Zambian man and the Japanese woman to defraud investors by falsely representing that (i) Standard Chartered Bank was holding on behalf of the Thai man asset of 3.3 billion euros (about HK$25.5 billion), which was assigned to ADF to finance and execute economic and humanitarian projects in Africa, (ii) the bank confirmed that a company of the Zambian man had funds of US$1.5 billion (about HK$11.6 billion) available for investments in Africa, and (iii) that company had asset of US$2 billion (about HK$15.5 billion) in the account held with the bank.ICAC inquiries revealed that Standard Chartered Bank had never held the aforesaid asset on behalf of the Thai man, while the Zambian man’s company had never hold any bank account with the bank. The above false representations involved issuance of false proof of fund letters.Three other charges allege that Woo and Chan conspired with Leung, Law, the Zambian man, the Korean man and the Japanese woman to defraud investors by falsely representing that Standard Chartered Bank was the guarantor of ADF which undertook to pay the relevant investors by way of eight CRPNs.It is alleged that the eight CRPNs involved promised returns totalling over US$207 million (about HK$1.6 billion). As a result of the false representations, various Japanese investors were deceived into making investments totalling at least JPY400 million (about HK$28.4 million) to ADF and a number of companies involved in this case.The remaining charge alleges that Kum conspired together with the Zambian man and the Korean man to deal with a total sum of over HK$7.3 million and over US$6.1 million (about HK$47.5 million) in an account in another bank, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the sum, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly represented the proceeds of an indictable offence.Standard Chartered Bank has rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.

The defendant was granted cash bail.At the material time, the defendant was a security guard of HKGL posted to Shui Chuen O Estate, a public housing estate in Shatin. A total of about 40 security guards worked at the estate under the supervision of a supervisor and several assistant supervisors.When an assistant supervisor was absent from duty, the supervisor had the discretion to appoint a security guard to act for the post.

12/1/2022,"Two former insurance agents charged by ICAC admit $750,000 commission fraud","Two former insurance agents, charged by the ICAC, today (January 12) admitted in court that they had conspired to defraud an insurance company of commissions totalling over $750,000 by falsely representing that one of them had handled 10 insurance policies.Tin Tak-ho, 47, former senior branch manager of Manulife (International) Limited (Manulife), and Alvin Tam Man-chan, 56, former insurance agent of Manulife, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law. Tin further pleaded guilty to five counts of forgery, contrary to Section 71 of the Crimes Ordinance.District Court Judge Mr Isaac Tam Sze-lok adjourned the case to February 9 for sentence. Tin was remanded in the custody of the Correctional Services Department while Tam was granted cash bail.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent enquiries revealed the above offences.The court heard that at the material time, Tin was a senior branch manager of Manulife and Tam was his down-line agent. When an insurance product of Manulife was sold, the handling agent would receive a commission while his up-line managers would receive overriding commissions and/or bonuses from Manulife.In December 2017, Manulife received 10 insurance policy application forms submitted by Tin. The application forms were purportedly signed by nine persons as applicants and Tam as the handling agent. Manulife subsequently released commissions totalling over $470,000 to Tam as the handling agent, and overriding commissions totalling about $280,000 to Tin in respect of those insurance policies.ICAC inquiries revealed that the duo had reached an agreement to name Tam as the handling agent of insurance policy applications secured by Tin. Tam did not procure the 10 insurance policies or meet the applicants concerned. The relevant initial premiums were arranged by Tin to pay to Manulife and Tam returned the commissions received from the company to Tin.Had Manulife known that the 10 application forms contained false information, it would not underwrote and issued the insurance policies, nor would it paid the commissions and overriding commissions to Tam and Tin respectively.Five of the relevant applicants confirmed that they had not applied for the insurance policies concerned and it was revealed that the relevant application forms were forged by Tin without their knowledge.Manulife had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Public Prosecutor Paggie Lee, assisted by ICAC officer William Leung.To protect the interests of all parties, policyholders are reminded to verify the policy details and identity of the handling agent when signing policy documents. Over the years, the ICAC has been actively promoting corruption prevention services to insurance organisations and arranging ethics training for practitioners.

The prosecution withdrew four counts of doing an act tending and intended to pervert the course of public justice against him.Acting Principal Magistrate Ms Peony Wong Nga-yan adjourned the case to February 8 for sentence, pending a community service order report of the defendant. The defendant was granted cash bail.It is an offence under the Rabies Ordinance for a dog keeper if his or her dog is not on a leash or under control in a public place (the offence).At the material time, Kowloon Animal Management Centre (the Centre) was responsible for handling stray dogs and the relevant criminal investigations on possible prosecutions against dog keepers for the offence. Staff of the Centre who conducted the relevant investigations were required to fill in a form, namely entitled “Information for Possible Prosecution (for stray dogs)” (Prosecution Form).When a person handed in a stray dog to the Centre, he or she was required to fill in a form, namely “Record for Handing in Stray Animal(s)” (Animal Form), and to indicate if he or she was willing to testify in court against the dog keepers.The defendant was a Field Officer II of the AFCD posted to the Centre. In May 2018, a person handed in a stray dog to the Centre and indicated in the Animal Form that he was willing to testify in court against the dog keeper.In a Prosecution Form subsequently submitted to his supervisor, the defendant falsely represented that the person was not willing to be a prosecution witness and recommended no prosecution against the dog keeper. An altered Animal Form purportedly showing that the person was unwilling to testify in court was attached as a supporting document.Between September 2018 and February 2019, the defendant had recommended no prosecution against the dog keepers in three other cases by similarly altering the relevant Animal Forms. As a result, no prosecution was initiated against the dog keepers in all four cases, the court heard.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint.

The landlord was a couple and the younger brother of the wife was entrusted to handle its leasing matters. Before leasing out the flat, the brother had to seek instructions from his elder sister.As the defendant did not make rental payments on time and had occasionally made payments in split sums by different bank accounts, the landlord subsequently decided not to renew the tenancy.In early 2016, the defendant negotiated with a potential investor for transferring the guesthouse business while he himself would remain its manager. Since then, the defendant had been trying to terminate his tenancy so that the new operator could sign a new agreement with the landlord.After negotiation, the landlord only agreed to lease the flat to the potential buyer on the condition that the defendant would no longer be involved in the guesthouse business.On December 13, 2016, the defendant sought assistance from the younger brother in persuading his elder sister to accept the new tenancy unconditionally, and offered free travel packages and reimbursements which amounted up to several thousand dollars to the younger brother.The court heard that the defendant reiterated the offer on several occasions in 2017 but the younger brother declined to accept it.On June 9, 2017, the defendant further offered “tea money” of $30,000 to the younger brother for the same purpose. The offer was also declined. The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Stephen Ma, assisted by ICAC officer Franki Law.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1259.html

Recruitment was conducted mainly through referrals by construction workers. Law and other construction workers, including Lin Weiwu, were led by a site team leader Hui Kwai-tuen to perform carpentry works at the project’s construction site.The court heard that in late 2020 and early 2021, Law introduced three other construction workers to work at the project’s construction site at a daily wage of $1,600. Law told the trio that they were required to pay $200 per working day as a rebate to Hui.Between January and May 2021, the trio had paid illegal rebates totalling $10,200 through Law or directly to Hui as they believed that they would not have been employed by MEL or would be terminated by Hui if they did not pay the rebates.Law earlier pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy for agent to accept advantages and rendered assistance to the prosecution.

Two workers were employed by Asian Projects and started to work for the construction project at a daily wage of $950 in September and October 2019 respectively.In October 2019, the defendant requested one of the workers to pay him $50 per working day as a rebate for referring him to work for Asian Projects. About a week later, the defendant accepted $1,000 cash from the worker, being rebates for the 20 days the latter worked at the aforesaid construction site.In December 2019, the defendant further solicited a rebate of $650 twice from the above worker. No payment was further made to the defendant.ICAC inquiries also revealed that on two other occasions in September and October 2019, the defendant told another worker that the latter was required to pay $50 per day as MPF contribution.Between October and December 2019, the construction worker transferred a total of $5,800 to the bank account of the defendant in the belief that he was contributing to his MPF.Asian Projects had not requested the defendant to recruit or refer fellow workers for the company.

29/12/2021,Ex-guesthouse operator charged by ICAC guilty of bribery over tenancy agreement,"A former guesthouse operator, charged by the ICAC, was today (December 29) convicted at the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts of offering bribes in cash, travel packages and reimbursements worth totalling over $30,000 to an agent of his landlord to resolve tenancy matters.Sze Ching-lok, 54, was found guilty of two counts of offering an advantage to an agent, contrary to Section 9(2)(a) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.Magistrate Mr Jacky Ip Kai-leung adjourned the case to January 11 next year for sentence, pending a background report. The defendant was remanded in the custody of the Correctional Services Department.The court heard that in April 2013, the defendant rented a flat in Yaumatei for a fixed term tenancy of five and a half years for operating a guesthouse. The landlord was a couple and the younger brother of the wife was entrusted to handle its leasing matters. Before leasing out the flat, the brother had to seek instructions from his elder sister.As the defendant did not make rental payments on time and had occasionally made payments in split sums by different bank accounts, the landlord subsequently decided not to renew the tenancy.In early 2016, the defendant negotiated with a potential investor for transferring the guesthouse business while he himself would remain its manager. Since then, the defendant had been trying to terminate his tenancy so that the new operator could sign a new agreement with the landlord.After negotiation, the landlord only agreed to lease the flat to the potential buyer on the condition that the defendant would no longer be involved in the guesthouse business.On December 13, 2016, the defendant sought assistance from the younger brother in persuading his elder sister to accept the new tenancy unconditionally, and offered free travel packages and reimbursements which amounted up to several thousand dollars to the younger brother.The court heard that the defendant reiterated the offer on several occasions in 2017 but the younger brother declined to accept it.On June 9, 2017, the defendant further offered “tea money” of $30,000 to the younger brother for the same purpose. The offer was also declined. The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Stephen Ma, assisted by ICAC officer Franki Law.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1251.html

The duo were among six charged by the ICAC for bribery in assisting construction workers to secure employment with the sub-contractor.Hui Kwai-tuen, 38, then site team leader of MLife Engineering Limited (MEL), was jailed for six months, while Lin Weiwu, 51, then construction worker of MEL, was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment. Hui was also ordered to repay $27,000, equivalent to the amount of bribes involved, to MEL as a restitution.In sentencing, Acting Chief Magistrate Mr Peter Law Tak-chuen remarked that the defendants had exploited fellow construction workers through accepting illegal rebates of quite a ratio of their daily wages. The offences were serious in nature and warranted immediate custodial sentences to serve as a deterrence to others.Hui yesterday (December 20) pleaded guilty to six charges – two of agent accepting an advantage, contrary to Section 9(1)(a) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO); and four of conspiracy for agent to accept advantages, contrary to Section 9(1)(a) of the POBO and Section 159A of the Crimes Ordinance. Lin yesterday pleaded guilty to one of the above conspiracy charges.At the material time, MEL was a sub-contractor of the Third Runway Project responsible for recruiting construction workers to conduct various works. Recruitment was conducted mainly through referrals by construction workers. Hui led a team of construction workers, including Lin and Law Chun-yik, to perform carpentry works at the project’s construction site.The court heard that Hui and Lin had respectively told two construction workers that they were required to pay $300 out of their $1,600 daily wage per working day as a rebate for keeping their employment. Between February and March 2021, Hui accepted through Lin or directly from the duo illegal rebates totalling $9,900 and $6,900 respectively.In late 2020 and early 2021, Law introduced three other construction workers to work at the project’s construction site at a daily wage of $1,600. Law told the trio that they were required to pay $200 per working day as rebate to Hui. Between January and May 2021, the trio had paid illegal rebates totalling $10,200 through Law or directly to Hui.The five construction workers believed that they would not have been employed by MEL or would be terminated by Hui if they did not pay the rebates.Law, 37, earlier pleaded guilty to three of the above conspiracy charges, also appeared at the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts this morning for mention. He was granted cash bail until January 11 next year for sentence, pending a community service order report.Three other then site team leaders of MEL, charged in two other cases, have their cases adjourned to next year for plea and trial respectively.The investigation arose from corruption complaints filed with the ICAC. The Airport Authority Hong Kong, the relevant main contractor SAPR JV and MEL had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the cases. ICAC enquiries are continuing and further arrests and prosecutions may be made.For the court proceedings of Hui and Lin, the prosecution was today represented by Acting Senior Public Prosecutor Steven Liu Wai-hung, assisted by ICAC officer Lai Yiu-wai.The ICAC calls upon contractors and sub-contractors to proactively adopt corruption prevention measures so as to prevent employees and agents from engaging in corrupt conduct in the recruitment of construction workers. The relevant measures include adopting a policy to prohibit employees and recruitment agents or service providers from soliciting and accepting referral fees from workers, paying for referral services of recruitment agents or service providers directly, enhancing transparency in workers’ payment or employment terms with written employment contracts, and using job-matching platforms such as the Construction Industry Council’s “easyJob” to recruit workers.The ICAC has stepped up its efforts in promoting the “Don’t bribe for Jobs” message to frontline construction workers under the Ethics Promotion Programme for Construction Industry. Workers are reminded to abide by the law and report to the Commission immediately should they be asked to pay illegal rebates.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1248.html

29/11/2021,Ex-Superintendent of Police charged by ICAC jailed for fraud over $6m housing and mortgage loans,"A then Superintendent of Police, charged by the ICAC, was today (November 29) sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment at the District Court for deceiving the Government and a bank into granting him housing and mortgage loans totalling about $6 million by falsely representing that a flat he purchased was used by his family while in fact it was let to others.Lung Siu-chuen, 55, was earlier found guilty of two counts of fraud, contrary to Section 16A of the Theft Ordinance. In sentencing, Judge Mr Fred Sham Siu-man said the defendant had obtained the loans by deceit and made false declarations, which were serious criminal offences. As a law enforcement officer, the defendant should know well that he should not break the law. The gravity of the offences increased as the defendant gained over $1 million rents through his criminal acts.The judge said he took a starting point of 24 months’ imprisonment and reduced the jail term to 18 months having considered that the defendant had no criminal record, his willingness to return the crime proceeds and other mitigating factors.The judge also ordered the defendant to make a restitution of around $1.16 million, being the amount of rents he obtained by leasing out the flat concerned, to the Government. The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint referred by the Treasury. Subsequent enquiries revealed the offences.The court heard that the defendant joined the Police Force in 1986 and was promoted to the rank of Superintendent in May 2019. He was entitled to apply for a Government housing loan under the Housing Loan Scheme (the Scheme).The live-in requirement under the Scheme is waived if an application is submitted within 10 years of his statutory age of retirement. But the property acquired with the aid of the Scheme could only be occupied by the applicant and/or the applicant’s family. Letting and subletting of the property is prohibited.On September 28, 2016, the defendant signed a provisional agreement for sale and purchase regarding a property with an existing tenant in Discovery Bay. On the following day, the defendant applied to the Treasury for a loan under the Scheme and also made a mortgage loan application to The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) for 60 per cent of the value of the property. He was due to retire within 10 years when the applications were made.The court heard that the defendant separately represented to the Treasury and HSBC that vacant possession of the property would be delivered on November 30, 2016, and the property would be used by his parents. But ICAC enquiries revealed that the defendant renewed the tenancy with the existing tenant of the property on November 27, 2016, and failed to comply with the requirements of the Scheme and HSBC by reporting the tenancy.Relying on the information provided by the defendant in his applications, the Government and HSBC respectively granted a housing loan of about $2.1 million and a mortgage loan of $3.9 million to the defendant on November 30, 2016.The Treasury would not have approved the defendant’s application should the department know that vacant possession of the property would not be delivered or that it would be let to others.At that time, the ceiling of the mortgage loan in respect of residential property purchased for self-use and investment was respectively fixed at 60 per cent and 50 per cent of the value of the property. Should HSBC know the property was not for self-use, the bank would not have approved the defendant’s application for a mortgage loan of $3.9 million, which amounted to 60 per cent of the value of the property.ICAC enquiries revealed that between December 2016 and August 2020, the defendant had leased out the property, generating an aggregated rental income of around $1.16 million.The Police Force, the Treasury and HSBC had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Bernard Chung, assisted by ICAC officer Jenny Chan.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1235.html

Limited (HKLIT), was earlier convicted of  five counts of using copies of false instruments, contrary to Section 74 of the Crimes Ordinance.In sentencing, Judge Fred Sham Siu-man noted that a custodial sentence was meted out to the defendant, who directly benefited from the scam. The judge added that the defendant was undoubtedly the main culprit of the premeditated fraud, causing a loss totalling over $15 million to the two banks.The case arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the offences.The court heard that in August 2010, the defendant became the sole director and shareholder of HKLIT, purportedly a giftware trading company, upon the request of his twin brother and the de facto owner of HKLIT. The offence took place between November 2013 and June 2015, during which HKLIT applied for banking facilities from two banks.In order to support the applications, the defendant submitted to the two banks copies of audited reports and financial statements of HKLIT purportedly issued by an accounting firm for the two financial years of 2011/12 and 2012/13, and copies of false bank statements of the company. Believing the documents were genuine, the banks concerned respectively granted banking facilities of $13 million and $6 million to HKLIT.After the banking facilities were granted to HKLIT, the two banks would conduct annual reviews to assess whether the banking facilities would be extended or suspended, or that legal actions would be taken for chasing full settlement of the outstanding loans.At the annual reviews, the defendant submitted to the two banks copies of audited reports and financial statements of HKLIT purportedly issued by the above accounting firm for the financial year of 2013/14 and false bank statements of the company. As a result, extension of the two banking facilities were approved.Had the two banks known that the aforesaid supporting documents were false, they would not have granted and extended the banking facilities to HKLIT.ICAC enquiries revealed that the defendant had also used copies of false bank statements of HKLIT to apply with one of the aforesaid banks for a temporary increase of $3 million credit limit. The application was subsequently withdrawn.The two banks and the accounting firm concerned have rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Bernard Chung, assisted by ICAC officer Benjamin Ho.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1233.html

Chung Ka-keung, 54, senior sales manager of Midland Realty (Commercial) Limited (Midland Realty), earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of agent accepting an advantage, contrary to Section 9(1)(a) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO).In sentencing, Deputy Magistrate Mr Wong Tsz-ho said he took a starting point of nine months’ imprisonment and reduced the defendant’s jail term to four months after taking into account his guilty plea and willingness to make a repayment to Midland Realty.The court heard that at the material time, Chung headed a branch of Midland Realty in Tsim Sha Tsui. His subordinates included a senior account manager, Ken Koo Chun-fai.For each property transaction procured by a property agent, Midland Realty generally would charge both the vendor and the purchaser one per cent of the transaction price as agency commission, and the amount would be taken into account in calculating the monthly sales commissions of the property agent. As the head of a branch, Chung would also earn an overriding commission for property transactions procured by his subordinates.The court heard that in December 2016, Chung instructed his subordinates to source commercial properties for a client of himself.In late February 2017, upon the recommendation of Chung and Koo, the client purchased two commercial properties in Shau Kei Wan at respectively $25 million and over $27.3 million, totalling over $52.3 million.Midland Realty subsequently paid sales commissions totalling over $280,000 and overriding commissions totalling about $150,000 respectively to Koo and Chung in connection with the two property transactions.

The defendant was granted cash bail.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint referred by the Treasury. Subsequent enquiries revealed the offences.The court heard that the defendant joined the Police Force in 1986 and was promoted to the rank of Superintendent in May 2019. He was entitled to apply for a Government housing loan under the Housing Loan Scheme (the Scheme).The live-in requirement under the Scheme is waived if an application is submitted within 10 years of his statutory age of retirement. But the property acquired with the aid of the Scheme could only be occupied by the applicant and/or the applicant’s family. Letting and subletting of the property is prohibited.On September 28, 2016, the defendant signed a provisional agreement for sale and purchase regarding a property with an existing tenant in Discovery Bay.

He was due to retire within 10 years when the applications were made.The court heard that the defendant separately represented to the Treasury and HSBC that vacant possession of the property would be delivered on November 30, 2016, and the property would be used by his parents. But ICAC enquiries revealed that the defendant renewed the tenancy with the existing tenant of the property on November 27, 2016, and failed to comply with the requirements of the Scheme and HSBC by reporting the tenancy.Relying on the information provided by the defendant in his applications, the Government and HSBC respectively granted a housing loan of about $2.1 million and a mortgage loan of $3.9 million to the defendant on November 30, 2016.The Treasury would not have approved the defendant’s application should the department know that vacant possession of the property would not be delivered or that it would be let to others.At that time, the ceiling of the mortgage loan in respect of residential property purchased for self-use and investment was respectively fixed at 60 per cent and 50 per cent of the value of the property. Should HSBC know the property was not for self-use, the bank would not have approved the defendant’s application for a mortgage loan of $3.9 million, which amounted to 60 per cent of the value of the property.ICAC enquiries revealed that between December 2016 and August 2020, the defendant had leased out the property, generating an aggregated rental income of about $1.2 million.The Police Force, the Treasury and HSBC had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Bernard Chung, assisted by ICAC officer Jenny Chan.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1223.html

Chung Ka-keung, 54, senior sales manager of Midland Realty (Commercial) Limited (Midland Realty), pleaded guilty to two counts of agent accepting an advantage, contrary to Section 9(1)(a) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO). The prosecution offered no evidence to another similar charge against him.Deputy Magistrate Mr Wong Tsz-ho adjourned the case to November 19 this year for sentence, pending a background report. Chung was granted cash bail. He was also ordered by the deputy magistrate to pay $118,000, which was equivalent to the bribes involved, as a restitution to Midland Realty.The court heard that at the material time, Chung headed a branch of Midland Realty in Tsim Sha Tsui. His subordinates included a senior account manager, Ken Koo Chun-fai. For each property transaction procured by a property agent, Midland Realty generally would charge both the vendor and the purchaser one per cent of the transaction price as agency commission, and the amount would be taken into account in calculating the monthly sales commissions of the property agent. As the head of a branch, Chung would also earn an overriding commission for property transactions procured by his subordinates.The court heard that in December 2016, Chung instructed his subordinates to source commercial properties for a client of himself.In late February 2017, upon the recommendation of Chung and Koo, the client purchased two commercial properties in Shau Kei Wan at respectively $25 million and over $27.3 million, totalling over $52.3 million.Midland Realty subsequently paid sales commissions totalling over $280,000 and overriding commissions totalling about $150,000 respectively to Koo and Chung in connection with the two property transactions. Upon Chung’s request, Koo eventually agreed to pay Chung half of his own sales commissions arising from the two transactions, after deducting 17.5 per cent of the amount for tax, as a reward for Chung’s assistance in procuring those transactions.ICAC enquires revealed that Chung eventually accepted two bribes totalling $118,000 from Koo.Koo, 48, who was charged by the ICAC in a separate case, pleaded guilty in May this year to three counts of offering an advantage to an agent, contrary to Section 9(2)(a) of the POBO. He was granted bail until December 21 this year for sentence.Midland Realty had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the aforesaid two cases.The prosecution was today represented by ICAC officer Derek Cheung.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1205.html
21/10/2021,Six charged by ICAC with bribery over Third Runway Project construction jobs,"Following enforcement actions taken by the ICAC earlier this year against illicit activities of soliciting and accepting illegal rebates from construction workers, the Commission today (October 21) charged six then employees of a sub-contractor of the Third Runway Project of the Hong Kong International Airport (Third Runway Project) with soliciting and accepting illegal rebates totalling about $70,000 from 11 others for securing their employment with the sub-contractor.The investigation arose from corruption complaints filed with the ICAC. After seeking legal advice from the Department of Justice, four site team leaders and two construction workers who assisted them to accept illegal rebates from others were charged in three cases at this stage.The defendants are Tang Amanjo Ho-yin, 42; He Chungui, 37; Ngan Lun-fung, 52; and Hui Kwai-tuen, 38; all site team leaders of MLife Engineering Limited (MEL); and Law Chun-yik, 37; and Lin Weiwu, 51, both construction workers of MEL. They were all released on ICAC bail, pending their court appearance in the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts next Monday (October 25) for plea.They face a total of 13 charges – two of agent soliciting an advantage and four of agent accepting an advantage, all contrary to Section 9(1)(a) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO); and seven of conspiracy for agent to accept advantages, contrary to Section 9(1)(a) of the POBO and Section 159A of the Crimes Ordinance.At the material time, MEL was a sub-contractor of the Third Runway Project responsible for recruiting construction workers to conduct various works. Recruitment was conducted mainly through referrals by construction workers. Tang, He, Ngan and Hui were site team leaders who led construction workers, including Law and Lin, to perform carpentry works at the project’s construction site.In the first case which took place between July 2020 and January 2021, Tang faces four charges. It is alleged that Tang had respectively conspired together with two construction workers in his team for Tang to accept illegal rebates totalling about $38,000 from the duo. Tang had also allegedly accepted illegal rebates totalling $1,400 from another two construction workers in his team.In the second case, He and Ngan face three charges which took place between October 2020 and March 2021. The duo had allegedly conspired together with a construction worker in their team for He to accept an illegal rebate of $2,000 from the construction worker. It is also alleged that He solicited $100 per working day and $1,000 per month from another construction worker in his team.The third case took place between January and May 2021. Hui, Law and Lin face a total of six charges. Hui had allegedly accepted illegal rebates totalling about $10,000 from a construction worker in his team. It is also alleged that Hui, and Law or Lin, respectively conspired together with another four construction workers in his team for Hui to accept illegal rebates totalling over $17,000 from the four construction workers.The charges allege that the defendants in the three cases had, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, solicited and accepted the above illegal rebates totalling about $70,000 from 11 construction workers as an inducement to or reward for assisting those construction workers to secure and to continue their employment with MEL.The Airport Authority Hong Kong, the relevant main contractor SAPR JV and MEL have rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the cases.The ICAC reminds construction workers that should they be asked to pay illegal rebates, they should report to the Commission immediately. The Commission will continue to closely monitor the situation in the industry and take appropriate enforcement actions.The Commission has stepped up its efforts in promoting the “Don’t bribe for Jobs” message to frontline construction workers under the Ethics Promotion Programme for Construction Industry and urges them not to tolerate corruption. These include the production of publicity materials and training video for deployment by industry organisations and construction companies. The ICAC has also incorporated related messages in corruption prevention talks attended by construction practitioners. Further information is available online (https://hkbedc.icac.hk/en/sector_industry/construction/28) and could also be obtained through ICAC Regional Offices.On the prevention front, the ICAC has advised and assisted the relevant government departments and public bodies to put in place measures to curb malpractices in the construction industry. The measures include clear policy prohibiting solicitation of referral fees from workers, transparency in workers’ employment or payment terms with written employment contracts, using job-matching platforms such as the Construction Industry Council (CIC)’s “easyJob” for recruiting workers or finding jobs, etc.The ICAC has also provided advice on recruitment of workers to individual companies upon request and worked closely with the CIC to raise the anti-corruption capability and awareness of practitioners in the private arm of the industry. The ICAC will continue to take appropriate measures to assist the industry to tackle the malpractice.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1203.html
21/10/2021,Woman charged by ICAC admits bribing recruitment officer for security guard job,"A woman, charged by the ICAC, today (October 21) admitted at the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts that she had offered bribes totalling $5,000 to a recruitment officer of a property developer for assisting her in securing a security guard job.Ke Meijing, 51, pleaded guilty to two counts of offering an advantage to an agent, contrary to Section 9(2)(a) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.Magistrate Daniel Tang Siu-hung adjourned the case to November 12 for sentence, pending probation and community service order reports of the defendant and granted her cash bail.The court heard that in mid-February 2021, Swire Properties Limited (Swire Properties) conducted a recruitment exercise for the post of security guard. The defendant applied for the post and attended an online interview On March 2, 2021, the defendant was informed by a recruitment officer of the company who assessed her performance that her application was unsuccessful.

In the same afternoon, the defendant left a bag of buns at the reception of the recruitment officer’s office and sent a mobile phone message to the recruitment officer asking her not to pass the buns to others. The recruitment officer reported the matter to her supervisor, who subsequently arranged to dispose of the bag of buns.In a series of mobile phone messages sent to the recruitment officer on March 4, 2021, the defendant said she had given $2,000 as “tea money” to the recruitment officer on the preceding day and would further offer $3,000 if she could complete the probation after being recruited.The recruitment officer immediately reported the matter to her supervisor but the bag of buns and the $2,000 could not be recovered.The court heard that the defendant had placed a “laisee” of $2,000 in the bag of buns delivered to the office of the recruitment officer and sent the aforesaid mobile phone messages to the recruitment officer afterwards.Swire Properties has rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by ICAC officer Brian Tse.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1204.html
20/10/2021,ICAC calls upon public bodies to adopt integrity management and fortify probity culture,"The ICAC today (October 20) called upon public bodies in Hong Kong to play an active role in adopting integrity management and support the promotion of a probity culture in their organisations.Over 200 representatives from the management or board members of around 80 public bodies today attended the Conference on Ethical Leadership for Public Bodies hosted by the Commission. Welcoming participants at the opening ceremony, the ICAC’s Director of Community Relations Ho Wai-chi noted that the operation of public bodies had a significant impact on public interests, adding that members of the public had high expectations on the ethical conduct of public officials.“Even a single corruption incident could ruin a public body’s reputation which might have taken the organisation many years to build up. Integrity management is hence the key to success for modern-day public bodies,"" Ho said.The Community Relations Department had launched a two-year Integrity Promotion Campaign for Public Bodies in 2020/21, aiming to strengthen corruption prevention education for public bodies’ staff and members, encourage these organisations to adopt integrity management and deepen their probity culture.A wide variety of anti-corruption education and training resources, including a one-stop thematic website, training videos, e-learning modules, integrity promotion information package, were produced for public bodies’ staff and members to enhance their awareness and understanding of the requirements of anti-corruption laws, as well as the key elements of integrity management.At today’s conference, the ICAC Citizens Advisory Committee on Community Relations member and Chief Corporate Development Officer of CLP Power Hong Kong Limited Quince Chong Wai-yan was invited to share with participants the importance of integrity in achieving sustainable development for public bodies.Other ICAC speakers included Director of Investigation Eric Tong Wing-tak; Assistant Director of Community Relations Corinna Wong Kit-mui and Assistant Director of Corruption Prevention Kenneth Wong Kwok-hung. They expounded on the latest corruption scene concerning public bodies, as well as the ICAC’s initiatives in promoting an ethical culture and enhancing corruption risk management system.There are currently over 100 public bodies in Hong Kong. While the business nature, scales and operation modes of these organisations might vary, their operations and services provided are closely related to people’s livelihood and are therefore defined as “public bodies” under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.For more details about the Integrity Promotion Campaign for Public Bodies, please visit the ICAC's thematic website (https://www.icac.org.hk/pb/en).",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1201.html
20/10/2021,Ex-manager of aircraft maintenance company charged by ICAC jailed for $1.5m order fraud,"A former manager of an aircraft maintenance company, charged by the ICAC, was today (October 20) sentenced to 27 months’ imprisonment at the District Court after being convicted of fraud over purchase orders for toolings which contained unnecessary technical drawings worth about $1.5 million.Wu Kwok-man, 65, former production engineering manager of Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company Limited (HAECO), was today found guilty of two counts of fraud, contrary to Section 16A(1) of the Theft Ordinance.In sentencing, Judge Stanley Chan Kwong-chi reprimanded the defendant for breaching the trust placed on him and abusing his power and position in HAECO. The defendant had also wasted the manpower and resources of the company, causing a loss to his former employer.The case arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the above offences.The court heard at the material time, HAECO provided aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul services to its clients. As the head of the component repair team of HAECO, the defendant was responsible for developing, manufacturing and purchasing toolings used in its aircraft maintenance and repair services. Contractors supplying toolings to HAECO were required to manufacture the toolings and provide the relevant technical drawings.Between February 2015 and October 2016, the defendant had caused HAECO to place 69 purchase orders worth totalling about $2.5 million with two contractors for manufacturing 185 toolings and the supply of the relevant technical drawings.HAECO received all the toolings but the two contractors could only provide some of the technical drawings. However, the technical drawings of all 185 toolings were subsequently found in HAECO’s internal system.ICAC enquiries revealed that the defendant had concealed from HAECO that he had instructed his subordinate engineers to design and prepare those technical drawings. The technical drawings submitted by one of the contractors were copied from technical drawings in HAECO’s system provided by the defendant.HAECO purchased the toolings with the two contractors at prices which included the supply of technical drawings which were not required in the first place. The prices involved amounted to about $1.5 million.HAECO did not allow the defendant to instruct its engineers to prepare technical drawings for contractors and to supply contractors with the technical drawings which belonged to HAECO. Had HAECO known that the company was in possession of the technical drawings concerned, it would not have placed the orders with the two contractors or settled the relevant payments with them.HAECO reported the matter to the ICAC after it was revealed, and rendered full assistance to the Commission during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Lisa Remedios, assisted by ICAC officers Frankie Chow and Francis Tsang.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1202.html
19/10/2021,Plumbing subcontractors charged by ICAC with $1m wage fraud,"The ICAC yesterday (October 18) charged two third-tier subcontractors of the construction projects of the Hong Kong Children’s Hospital and a private residential estate in Ma On Shan with defrauding two second-tier subcontractors of wage payments totalling about $1 million by overstating daily wages of eight plumbers.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. Upon completion of the investigation, the ICAC sought legal advice from the Department of Justice, which advised charging the two third-tier plumbing subcontractors.Sze Kin-chung, 48, and Chu Cheuk-wah, 58, jointly face two counts of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law. Sze alone further faces six counts of fraud, contrary to Section 16A of the Theft Ordinance. The offences took place between November 2016 and September 2018.The defendants were released on ICAC bail, pending their court appearance in the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts tomorrow (October 20) for the case to be transferred to the District Court for plea.At the material time, Kin Win Engineering Limited (Kin Win) and Onplus Plumbing Engineering Limited (Onplus) took part in two construction projects respectively involving the Hong Kong Children’s Hospital and a private residential estate in Ma On Shan as second-tier subcontractors. Operators of the two second-tier subcontractors subcontracted the plumbing work of the two projects to Sze and Chu.According to the subcontracting agreements, Sze and Chu were required to supply plumbers to Kin Win and Onplus for the two projects and report the exact daily wages of the plumbers for wage calculation.One of the charges alleges that Sze and Chu conspired together to defraud Kin Win and Onplus that a plumber had requested a daily wage of $1,500, thereby inducing Kin Win and Onplus to calculate and release wages to the plumber based on the requested daily wage.Another charge alleges that the two defendants conspired together to defraud Kin Win that another plumber had requested a daily wage of $1,150 by similar fraudulent means.Two other charges allege that Sze falsely represented to Kin Win and Onplus that another two plumbers had each requested a daily wage of $1,500 and with intent to defraud, induced Kin Win and Onplus to calculate and release wages to the two plumbers based on the requested daily wages which resulted in the benefit to Sze or in prejudice to Kin Win and Onplus.The four remaining charges allege that Sze falsely represented to Kin Win that another four plumbers had requested a daily wage of $1,400 and $1,500 respectively by similar fraudulent means.ICAC enquiries revealed that the actual daily wages requested by the eight plumbers in fact ranged from $750 to $1,100 but they were overstated by Sze and Chu to Kin Win and Onplus to a range from $1,150 to $1,500. The total wages were overstated by about $1 million.The Hospital Authority, Kin Win and Onplus have rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1200.html

Upon completion of the investigation, the ICAC sought legal advice from the Department of Justice, which advised charging the applicant with one count of bribery.Yang Jigang, 62, faces one count of offering an advantage to an agent, contrary to Section 9(2) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance. He was released on ICAC bail, pending his court appearance in the Kowloon City Magistrates’ Courts on Wednesday (October 20) for plea.At the material time, the defendant was an applicant of the One-off Allowance for New Arrivals from Low-income Families Programme of the CCF.The programme is administered by the CCF Secretariat under the Home Affairs Bureau (HAB).

When additional information was received in relation to his application, a banknote of $500 was found in an envelope addressed to the CCF Secretariat.The HAB and the CCF Secretariat have rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The ICAC reminds members of the public not to offer bribe to obtain public service. If fees and charges are required for a particular public service, the amount required and payment method would be made public. It is illegal for any applicant to offer extra “handling fee” or gift as a reward.Apart from offering corruption prevention advice on various public funding schemes, the ICAC has produced a toolkit recommending scheme administrators to put in place corruption prevention measures to enhance transparency in the handling of applications for funding or subsidy. For example, they should disclose to applicants the approval criteria and documents and information required for application, with a view to preventing the applicants who are not familiar with the application procedures from bribing their staff in return for approving their applications.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1198.html
18/10/2021,"Ex-employee of vehicle distributor charged by ICAC jailed for Euro 50,000 warranty claim fraud","A former employee of a vehicle distributor, charged by the ICAC, was today (October 18) sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment at the Fanling Magistrates’ Courts for defrauding a vehicle manufacturer of warranty claims for repair works totalling over Euro 50,000.Leung Pak-lim, 35, former technical officer of Regal Motors Limited (Regal Motors) was earlier found guilty of two charges – one of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law; and one of conspiracy to use a false instrument, contrary to Sections 73 and 159A of the Crimes Ordinance.In sentencing, Magistrate Mr Kenneth Chan Ping-chau said the case involved an overseas victim. The offences committed by the defendant had harmed the interest of honest business operators and undermined Hong Kong’s image as a clean and level playing field for businesses. Hence, there was no justification for any reduction in the defendant’s jail term.The case arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the above offences.The court heard that between 1970 and 2019, Regal Motors was the sole distributor of products of German vehicle manufacturer MAN Truck & Bus SE (MAN Truck & Bus) in Hong Kong. MAN Truck & Bus provided a two-year warranty for chassis of vehicles sold by Regal Motors. Where repairs conducted by Regal Motors for its customers were covered by warranties, it was required to submit warranty claims to MAN Truck & Bus.At the material time, the defendant was a technical officer posted to Regal Motors’ technical team. The team was responsible for assisting customers to activate their warranties, and submit warranty claims for repair works covered by warranty.In May 2018, the defendant conspired with a technical trainee of Regal Motors to activate the warranty of a customer’s vehicle by submitting a false vehicle registration document to MAN Truck & Bus.ICAC enquiries revealed that the first registration date was amended by the defendant to a later date as the deadline for activating the warranty had passed. Thus, MAN Truck & Bus was induced to approve the application for activating the warranty.Regal Motors subsequently conducted repairs for the vehicle on four occasions and the repair costs, totalling over Euro 6,900, were borne by MAN Truck & Bus under the warranty.The court also heard that in June 2018, the defendant found that some vehicles repaired by Regal Motors were not covered by warranty. He then conspired with the assistant technical manager of the technical team and the aforesaid technical trainee to submit 53 false warranty claims to MAN Truck & Bus between June and November 2018. They falsely represented that the warranty claims involved vehicles of similar models covered by warranty. As a result, MAN Truck & Bus was induced to settle warranty claims totalling over Euro 43,000.Regal Motors and MAN Truck & Bus had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Stephen Ma, assisted by ICAC officer Tom Li.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1199.html
16/10/2021,Four charged by ICAC sentenced for conspiracy to defraud over bonds placement of listed company,"Four persons, including two former senior executives of a then listed company, charged by the ICAC, were today (October 16) sentenced to jail terms up to seven months at the District Court for conspiracy to defraud the company and its board of directors and shareholders as well as The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK) over the placement of bonds issued by the listed company.Mak Kwong-yiu, 47, former executive director of Convoy Financial Services Holdings Limited (Convoy Financial Services) was jailed for seven months, while Lee Yick-ming, 51, former general manager of Gransing Securities Co., Limited (Gransing), received a jail term of five months.Co-defendants Chan Lai-yee, 49, former financial controller of Convoy Financial Services (later promoted to chief financial officer) and Wong Shuk-on, 42, former manager of Convoy Financial Services, were respectively sentenced to five months’ and four months’ imprisonment, both suspended for 18 months.In addition, Mak and Chan were respectively disqualified from being company directors for three years and two years.In sentencing, Deputy Judge Mr Newman Wong said the court had considered the adverse impacts of the case on the society and the financial system. He also reprimanded Mak for not following the listing rules and not declaring his conflict of interests. Failure to observe the law was unacceptable in Hong Kong.The four defendants were earlier convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law. Mak, Chan and Wong were further found guilty of another similar offence.The court heard that at the material time, Convoy Financial Services, later renamed as Convoy Financial Holdings Limited, was listed (publicly listed Convoy) on the Main Board of the SEHK. Gransing and Convoy Investment Services Limited (CIS), which was not a subsidiary of publicly listed Convoy, both provided dealing in securities regulated activity, such as bonds placement.Mak and two other former executive directors of publicly listed Convoy held substantial shares of CIS. The annual report of publicly listed Convoy at the material time disclosed that CIS was its connected person.On four occasions between July 8, 2014 and January 21, 2015, publicly listed Convoy engaged Gransing as the placing agent of four bond placing exercises of the publicly listed Convoy.The court heard that the defendants conspired together to arrange Gransing to further engage CIS as the sub-placing agent of the four exercises. One of the sub-placing letters was issued two weeks before Gransing was engaged by the publicly listed Convoy as a placing agent.CIS subsequently received around $49.6 million as sub-placing commission from publicly listed Convoy via Gransing and $1.2 million as bonus from Gransing under the sub-placing arrangements. In fact, Gransing did not place any bonds with any investor and CIS was the actual placing agent.The court heard that it was never disclosed to publicly listed Convoy and its board of directors and shareholders as well as the SEHK that CIS was the actual placing agent of the four bonds.Failure of the disclosure would have deprived shareholders of publicly listed Convoy of the right to vote for or against the sub-placing arrangements, and hindered SEHK’s enforcement of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the SEHK.ICAC’s investigation commenced upon receiving complaints in 2017 which alleged breaches of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance and the Securities and Futures Ordinance. The ICAC and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) jointly mounted an operation in December 2017. The SFC, SEHK and the then publicly listed Convoy have rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation.The ICAC will continue to collaborate with relevant regulatory bodies, including the SFC, to combat corrupt and illicit activities in the financial market so as to uphold the integrity of the market, maintain a level playing field for businesses, and sustain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre.The ICAC has made continuous and proactive efforts in assisting listed companies in enhancing their corporate governance. The ICAC has developed and publicised on its website a practical guide to assist listed companies to put in place good corporate governance systems and effective internal control measures; and has also been offering free and tailor-made service to assist listed companies in enhancing their corporate governance upon request.The ICAC attaches great importance to the integrity standard of listed companies. Through the Ethics Promotion Programme for listed companies and continuous professional development courses, messages of ethical leadership and good corporate governance have been promulgated to directors, senior executives and governance professionals of listed companies for safeguarding the interest of different stakeholders. The Commission also approaches all newly listed companies proactively to promote our corruption prevention services, including training for all levels of staff to enhance their understanding of the anti-corruption law and remind them to comply with relevant laws and regulations.The prosecution was today represented by Acting Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions Jonathan Man, Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Alice Chan and Senior Public Prosecutor Human Lam, assisted by ICAC officers Esther Poon and Neville Wong.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1197.html

Tse was earlier sentenced to a jail term of two months, suspended for 12 months.The case arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the above offences.The court heard that at the material time, Tsang was separately employed as driver by TNT Express Worldwide (HK) Limited (TNT), The Garden Company Limited (Garden) and Hong Kong Television Networks Limited (HKTV). Tse was a registered Chinese medicine practitioner and the operator of a Chinese medical clinic—Hong Tak Tong.Between May 2016 and November 2018, Tsang respectively reported work injury to the three companies and took sick leaves by submitting 88 medical certificates issued by Tse. The sick leave certificates stated that Tsang was suffering from back pain.

He further submitted various other medical certificates and receipts to the two companies to falsely claim work injury compensations amounting to about $49,000.Should Garden and HKTV know that Tsang was fit to work for another employer when he was granted sick leave, they would not have approved and released the relevant compensations to Tsang, the court heard.TNT, Garden and HKTV had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by ICAC officer Michael Lau.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1194.html
30/9/2021,Business consultant charged by ICAC jailed for fraud over sale and purchase of tutorial centre,"A consultant of a business brokerage firm, charged by the ICAC, was today (September 30) sentenced to three months’ imprisonment at the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts for deceiving the seller and buyer of a tutorial centre over the transaction price.Cheuk Yat-long, 35, business consultant of HKBX Company Limited (HKBX), was earlier found guilty of one count of fraud, contrary to Section 16A(1) of the Theft Ordinance.In sentencing, Magistrate Miss Veronica Heung Shuk-han said a custodial sentence was necessary as the case was serious in nature and the acts of the defendant constituted a breach of trust.The case arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the above offence.The court heard that at the material time, the defendant was a business consultant of HKBX, a business brokerage firm procuring the sale and purchase of business ventures for prospective sellers and buyers. He was responsible for assisting the two parties in the negotiation and discussion regarding the sale and purchase of businesses.In mid-March 2019, the owner of a tutorial centre in Shenzhen engaged HKBX to look for a buyer for the tutorial centre and the asking price was RMB 200,000. Upon the suggestion of HKBX, the owner agreed to set a higher listed price to RMB 428,000 on its sales platform to leave room for negotiation.A prospective buyer later indicated interest in purchasing the tutorial centre and instructed the defendant to negotiate with the seller to lower the price. Without consulting the seller, the defendant informed the prospective buyer that the seller agreed to lower the price to RMB 400,000. The prospective buyer accepted the offer. The defendant then arranged both parties to sign a sale and purchase agreement separately.In addition, the defendant arranged the seller to sign a listing agreement which stated that the latter would only receive RMB 200,000 for selling the tutorial centre. The defendant had never disclosed to the seller that the actual transaction price was RMB 400,000, and he did not disclose that HKBX would pocket the price difference of RMB 200,000 out of the transaction.The buyer believed that the tutorial centre would be sold at a consideration of RMB 400,000 and paid the same to HKBX. He also paid HK$40,000 as its service fee.The court heard that the seller eventually only received RMB 200,000 from HKBX. The defendant received over HK$82,000 as commission from HKBX for the sale and purchase concerned.Had the buyer known that the intended selling price of the tutorial centre was lower than the sum he actually paid, and that HKBX had pocketed the price difference, the buyer would not have entered into the transaction. The seller would not have signed the listing agreement and agreed to receive only RMB 200,000 had he known that the buyer in fact offered to purchase the tutorial centre at RMB 400,000.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Eddie Sean, assisted by ICAC officer Simon Ip.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1192.html

In addition to signifying the two organisations’ determination in upholding the integrity of the financial market, it also sets out the framework for cooperation and collaboration and provides guidance on matters such as referral of cases, joint investigations, exchange of information and mutual investigative assistance,” Mr Peh added.FRC Chairman Dr Kelvin Wong said: “The MoU has strengthened the spectrum of regulatory collaboration between the FRC and the ICAC. It will enable us to expand and expedite our cooperation on case referrals, joint operations on investigations, training and exchange of information. Through the MoU, I am confident that we will achieve our mutual goal of combating misconduct in Hong Kong’s financial markets, thereby maintaining Hong Kong’s reputation as a fair and competitive international financial centre.”The ICAC and the FRC have established regular liaison before the signing of the MoU.

29/9/2021,Ex-manager of lighting product company charged by ICAC jailed for 56 months over $12m fraud,"A former manager of a lighting product company, charged by the ICAC, was today (September 29) sentenced to 56 months’ imprisonment at the District Court for defrauding his then employer by concealing his wife’s interest in a trading company when handling transactions between the two companies involving sums of discount and subsidy totalling about $12 million.Leung Chun-hei, 41, former senior sales manager of Philips Lighting Hong Kong Limited (Philips Lighting), earlier pleaded guilty to one count of fraud, contrary to Section 16A(1) of the Theft Ordinance.In sentencing, Judge Mrs Adriana Noelle Tse Ching said the defendant had intentionally and premeditatedly deceived the company. His acts constituted a breach of trust and were no different from theft.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent enquiries revealed the above offence.The court heard that Philips Electronics Hong Kong Limited (Philips Electronics) was a company which supplied electronic products, including lighting products. The defendant joined Philips Electronics in April 2003. In February 2016, the defendant was transferred to Philips Lighting after it was set up to specialise in selling lighting products.During his employment with Philips Lighting, the defendant was responsible for handling orders placed by customers, including Supreme Profits International Limited (Supreme Profits)—a trading company in which his wife was the sole shareholder-cum-director. He was authorised to utilise promotion funds for clients to subsidise or give discount to Supreme Profits.Between February 2016 and November 2018, Supreme Profits had placed 3,848 purchase orders with Philips Lighting for total invoiced amount of about $107 million. During the period, a total sum of about $12 million from the promotion funds was used to subsidise Supreme Profits.The court heard that when the defendant joined Philips Electronics, he acknowledged receipt of a booklet of General Business Principles which stipulated that employees should promptly disclose any personal financial interest direct or indirect via a family member or acquaintance which could give rise to a conflict of interest.In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the defendant attended training conducted by an in-house legal counsel of Philips Lighting during which attendees were reminded to report any actual or potential conflict of interest to the company. But the defendant had never made any declaration to the company about his wife’s role and interest in Supreme Profits.Had Philips Lighting known that the defendant’s wife was the owner of Supreme Profits, it would have assigned other staff members to handle the transactions with Supreme Profits, and that it would not have agreed to the defendant’s suggestion to use the promotion funds to subsidise Supreme Profits.Philips Electronics and Philips Lighting had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Public Prosecutor Anthea Kwok, assisted by ICAC officer Ray Chan.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1191.html

20/9/2021,Four charged by ICAC guilty of conspiracy to defraud over bonds placement of listed company,"Four persons, including two former senior executives of a then listed company, charged by the ICAC, were today (September 20) convicted at the District Court of conspiracy to defraud the company and its board of directors and shareholders as well as The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK) over the placement of bonds issued by the listed company.Mak Kwong-yiu, 47, former executive director of Convoy Financial Services Holdings Limited (Convoy Financial Services); Chan Lai-yee, 49, former financial controller of Convoy Financial Services (later promoted to chief financial officer); Wong Shuk-on, 42, former manager of Convoy Financial Services; and Lee Yick-ming, 51, former general manager of Gransing Securities Co., Limited (Gransing), were convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law. Mak, Chan and Wong were further found guilty of another similar offence.Deputy Judge Mr Newman Wong adjourned the case to October 9 for mitigation. The defendants were granted cash bail.The ICAC investigation commenced upon receiving complaints in 2017 which alleged breaches of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance and the Securities and Futures Ordinance. An operation was jointly mounted with the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in December 2017. Upon completion of the investigation, the ICAC sought legal advice from the Department of Justice, which advised charging the four defendants.The court heard that at the material time, Convoy Financial Services, later renamed as Convoy Financial Holdings Limited, was listed (publicly listed Convoy) on the Main Board of the SEHK. Gransing and Convoy Investment Services Limited (CIS), which was not a subsidiary of publicly listed Convoy, both provided dealing in securities regulated activity, such as bonds placement.Mak and two other former executive directors of publicly listed Convoy held substantial shares of CIS. The annual report of publicly listed Convoy at the material time disclosed that CIS was its connected person.On four occasions between July 8, 2014 and January 21, 2015, publicly listed Convoy engaged Gransing as the placing agent of four bond placing exercises of the publicly listed Convoy.The court heard that the defendants conspired together to arrange Gransing to further engage CIS as the sub-placing agent of the four exercises. One of the sub-placing letters was issued two weeks before Gransing was engaged by the publicly listed Convoy as a placing agent.CIS subsequently received around $49.6 million as sub-placing commission from publicly listed Convoy via Gransing and $1.2 million as bonus from Gransing under the sub-placing arrangements. In fact, Gransing did not place any bonds with any investor and CIS was the actual placing agent.The court heard that it was never disclosed to publicly listed Convoy and its board of directors and shareholders as well as the SEHK that CIS was the actual placing agent of the four bonds.Failure of the disclosure would have deprived shareholders of publicly listed Convoy of the right to vote for or against the sub-placing arrangements, and hindered SEHK’s enforcement of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the SEHK.The SFC, SEHK and the then publicly listed Convoy have rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation.The prosecution was today represented by Acting Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions Jonathan Man, Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Alice Chan and Senior Public Prosecutor Human Lam, assisted by ICAC officers Esther Poon and Neville Wong.An ICAC spokesperson said over the years the ICAC has strived to foster an ethical culture within the business community, and assist listed companies to enhance their corporate governance and directors’ ethics. The ICAC will continue to collaborate with relevant regulatory bodies, including the SFC, to combat corrupt and illicit activities in the financial market so as to uphold the integrity of the market, maintain a level playing field for businesses, and sustain Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1182.html

Lui Ah-fook added that the trio were required to register as voters and vote as instructed in the ITFC of the 2016 LegCo General Election (the scheme). Lui Wai-fong also extended the invitation to her relatives, including Chan Ki-nam.The court heard that in mid-April 2016, Lui King-yin mentioned the scheme in two mobile phone chat groups with his schoolmates and associates. The four convicted defendants were group members of either one of the chat groups. Lui King-yin also noted that he would deduct $150 from the $1,000 and asked group members to invite friends to participate in it.After Lui Ah-fook, Lui Wai-fong and Lui King-yin gathered the personal particulars of 36 persons, including those of the four convicted defendants, Lui Ah-fook forwarded the consolidated information to Li on April 24, 2016.In mid-April 2016, Li started to send personal particulars of a number of persons to Poon for IEEE membership registration. Between April 12 and May 1, 2016, about 127 persons, including Li, Yeung Yiu-hung, Poon, and the aforesaid 36 persons associated with the Luis, were registered as full members of the IEEE with false information about their professional qualification, education and/or experience.Between April and May 2016, the IEEE membership fees of about US$32,000 (about HK$250,000) for several hundred persons were paid by Yeung Yiu-hung’s credit cards. The payments were subsequently settled by Li, mostly through cash deposited into Yeung Yiu-hung’s bank account at automatic teller machines.Between April 30 and May 2, 2016, the REO received the voter registration forms of 124 persons, all carrying the same typo misspelling “Engineers” in the full name of IEEE as “Enginess”. Based on their IEEE memberships, 118 of them were included in the 2016 Final Register of Electors of the ITFC.On May 21, 2016, Lui Wai-fong, Lui King-yin and Chan Ki-nam each collected $1,000 from Lui Ah-fook. On the following day, Lui King-yin paid $850 each to Chan Wing-hang, Kwok Ka-kin and Lim Chak-him during a dinner gathering. Ng Ka-ho also received $700 from Lui King-yin in the same month.Before the polling day, Li sent a message to Yeung Yiu-hung, Lui Ah-fook and Lui Wai-fong via a mobile phone chat group called “IE Group”, urging them to vote for Yeung Chuen-sing, a candidate competing in the ITFC at the 2016 LegCo General Election. On the polling day, Lui Wai-fong and Lui King-yin made the same appeal to participants in several mobile phone chat groups.The court heard that 19 out of the aforesaid 36 persons associated with the Luis had applied for ballot papers, including those for the ITFC, at their respective polling stations. Yeung Chuen-sing’s rival was elected in the ITFC at the 2016 LegCo General Election.The REO had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions David Chan, prosecuting counsel Newman Wong and Arthur Wong, and Public Prosecutor Dimitri Au-Yeung, assisted by ICAC officers Joseph Leung and Oscar Lau.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1179.html

Tam and Huang were granted cash bail.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent enquiries revealed the above offences which took place between September 1, 2016 and June 29, 2018.The court heard that at the material time, Tam was the branch manager of Cheung Fat branch while Lam Chi-hang was his downline agent.

To avoid sharing the additional commissions with the cooperating property agents, Tam used three bogus provisional tenancy agreements to mislead Midland Realty that Tam and his wife, who was also his subordinate, had procured three tenancy agreements in relation to two properties in Ma Wan and a property in Tsing Yi. Tam gave those additional commissions to Midland Realty as the clients’ commissions in relation to those bogus transactions.As a result, Midland Realty was misled to pay totalling over $15,000 more to Tam and his wife as sales commissions and overriding commissions.The court also heard that the commission of $50,000 in relation to a sale and purchase transaction should have been shared among Huang and three other cooperating property agents of Midland Realty.But Huang misled the agency by using a bogus provisional tenancy agreement that she had procured a tenancy transaction in relation to another property in Tsing Yi, and that the commission was only allocated to Huang and one of the aforesaid cooperating property agents. Huang therefore received about $600 more from Midland Realty as sales commission.Co-defendants Lam, 39, and Lee, 56, earlier pleaded guilty to four charges – three of conspiracy for agent to use document with intent to deceive his principal and one of agent using document with intent to deceive his principal.

The defendant was remanded in the custody of the Correctional Services Department.The case arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the above offence.The court heard that at the material time, the defendant was a business consultant of HKBX, a business brokerage firm procuring the sale and purchase of business ventures for prospective sellers and buyers. He was responsible for assisting the two parties in the negotiation and discussion regarding the sale and purchase of businesses.In mid-March 2019, the owner of a tutorial centre in Shenzhen engaged HKBX to look for a buyer for the tutorial centre and the asking price was RMB 200,000. Upon the suggestion of HKBX, the owner agreed to set a higher listed price to RMB 428,000 on its sales platform to leave room for negotiation. A prospective buyer later indicated interest in purchasing the tutorial centre and instructed the defendant to negotiate with the seller to lower the price. Without consulting the seller, the defendant informed the prospective buyer that the seller agreed to lower the price to RMB 400,000. The prospective buyer accepted the offer. The defendant then arranged both parties to sign a sale and purchase agreement separately.In addition, the defendant arranged the seller to sign a listing agreement which stated that the latter would only receive RMB 200,000 for selling the tutorial centre. The defendant had never disclosed to the seller that the actual transaction price was RMB 400,000, and he did not disclose that HKBX would pocket the price difference of RMB 200,000 out of the transaction.The buyer believed that the tutorial centre would be sold at a consideration of RMB 400,000 and paid the same to HKBX.

27/8/2021,ICAC launches all-embracing clean election drive for upcoming EC Subsector Elections,"The ICAC has launched a comprehensive education and publicity campaign to reach out to all stakeholders of the Election Committee (EC) Subsector Elections and appeal to them to abide by the law in the upcoming poll to ensure they are clean and fair.The 2021 EC Subsector Elections will be held on September 19. At an online briefing organised yesterday (August 26) by the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC), Franklin Chiu Yu-tat, ICAC Programme Coordinator (Clean Elections) apprised candidates and election agents on major provisions of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance (ECICO) as well as common concerns in past public elections.“Under the enhanced electoral system, the number of eligible voters and designated bodies have greatly increased.  New subsectors and functional constituencies are also created and they will participate in the election for the first time.  To help new stakeholders to better understand the ECICO and avoid inadvertently breaches of the electoral law, the Community Relations Department (CRD) will explain to them the legal requirements, including things to note when organising election activities and publishing election advertisements, as well as requirements in relation to election expenses,” said Chiu.The department has adopted an all-embracing strategy to disseminating the clean election messages through related umbrella organisations such as professional bodies, chambers of commerce and trade associations, as well as through its long-established district networks.Since May this year, the CRD has successfully arranged over 130 election briefings for these organisations, including all Area Committees as well as District Fight Crime Committees and District Fire Safety Committees in the 18 districts across the territory.  At these briefings, participants were briefed on the gist of the electoral law and were reminded the importance of upholding clean and fair elections.In addition, candidates and their helpers are urged to refer to an information booklet produced by the Commission.  Consisting a Questions and Answers section on issues commonly encountered in previous elections; a Gist of Past Election Cases; a Dos and Don’ts Checklist and channels for making reports and enquiries to the ICAC, the booklet was distributed to candidates, with the assistance of the Registration and Electoral Office (REO), when they submitted their nomination forms. The ICAC has also launched a dedicated webpage for the EC Subsector Elections (https://www.icac.org.hk/en/ce/index.html) to introduce the Commission’s education and publicity initiatives with filmlets and reference materials.  An enquiry hotline (2920 7878) has also been set up to answer public enquiries about the ECICO and the Commission’s education and publicity programmes for the upcoming elections, Chiu noted.The Commission will send out a leaflet to all candidates after the election to remind them to submit their election returns to REO in accordance with the legal requirements, whether they are uncontested, elected or otherwise.On the preventive front, the ICAC’s Corruption Prevention Department (CPD) has provided guiding principles for all organisations participating in the registration, nomination and voting of the EC Subsector Elections.  CPD officers have also reached out to those organisations participating in public elections for the first time and remind them the relevant requirements under the ECICO as well as the corrupt and malpractice risks concerning the registration, nomination and election procedures. Tailored corruption prevention advice will be offered based on the actual operation of each organisation, with a view to setting up proper mechanism and procedures.CPD officers will visit some of the polling stations on the voting day to observe the actual voting and counting procedures, so as to recommend graft preventive and enhancement measures for future elections.The ICAC’s Operations Department stands ready to enforce the law where corrupt and illegal conduct in elections are unearthed, regardless of the background, social status and identity of the persons involved. Under the Improving Electoral System (Consolidated Amendments) Ordinance 2021, two new offences have been included in the ECICO, namely wilfully obstructing and preventing another person from voting at an election as a corrupt conduct; and inciting voters not to vote, to cast blank or invalid votes by way of public activity during an election period as an illegal conduct. The ICAC will be on the lookout for any acts which may constitute manipulating or sabotaging the elections, and will take robust enforcement actions if necessary. Should any person be found to have incited another person not to vote, cast a blank or invalid vote on social media platforms or websites during the elections, the ICAC, in the course of investigation, may proactively request those platforms or websites to remove any content which may constitute a breach of the electoral law.For the upcoming EC Subsector Elections, investigators will also visit polling stations to handle complaints and enquiries relating to the ECICO on the spot, and take appropriate enforcement actions whenever necessary.The ICAC will maintain close liaison and cooperation with other government bodies, such as the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, the Department of Justice, the EAC and REO as well as the Police Force.Meanwhile, should members of the public come across suspected breaches of the ECICO, they are encouraged to report in person to the ICAC Report Centre or any of the seven regional offices, or call the 24-hour ICAC Report Centre hotline at 2526 6366.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1166.html

He was earlier found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law.Co-defendant Lam Cheuk-ho, 33, former event project and operation manager of China Art Financial Holdings Limited (China Art Financial), who earlier pleaded guilty to the aforesaid charge, received a jail term of six months.In sentencing, Deputy District Judge Miss Lily Wong Sze-lai remarked that the defendants deserved immediate custodial sentences since their conduct breached the trust placed on them and impaired fair competitions in the commercial world.The case arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the above offence.The court heard that at the material time, Lam was the event project and operation manager of China Art Financial, which was an art finance service provider engaged in art auction business. Artfund International (Hong Kong) Auction Company Limited (Artfund) was a subsidiary of China Art Financial. Kwok was an employee of Bigred, a renovation contractor of Artfund.In early 2018, Artfund rented an office at a commercial building in Wan Chai and engaged Bigred to renovate it as a showroom. A few months later, China Art Financial decided to abort the renovation project and disputed the termination fee with Bigred.Lam was instructed by China Art Financial to look for another contractor to reinstate the half renovated showroom before terminating the leasing contract. Bigred wanted to bid for the reinstatement project but was not allowed to do so.The court heard that Lam and Kwok then conspired together to defraud Artfund by dishonestly using a small renovation project contractor owned by an associate of Kwok’s brother as a vehicle to bid for the reinstatement project.On August 8, 2018, Lam submitted six quotations to China Art Financial for the reinstatement project. One of the quotations at $368,000, which was personally handled by Kwok, was from the small renovation project contractor.A few days later, Lam asked Kwok to lower his bid by $20,000 to $350,000 as the quoting price of another bidder was very close to that of the small renovation project contractor’s.Kwok agreed to lower the bidding price and the reinstatement project was eventually awarded to the small renovation project contractor at $350,000. But the project was in fact conducted by Bigred.Had China Art Financial known that the reinstatement project was conducted by Bigred, it would not have awarded the project to the small renovation project contractor, the court heard.China Art Financial had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by prosecuting counsel Newman Wong, assisted by ICAC officer Rosita Lee.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1164.html

Limited (Tomi Fuji), received a jail term of 18 months, while Wong Tsui-ting, 33, then assistant of Tomi Fuji, was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.In sentencing, Ms Amy Chan Wai-mun, sitting as Deputy District Judge, said the fraudulent acts of the defendants deprived the funding applicant in this case of enjoying the benefit of fair business competition and led to a misuse of public fund. It was necessary to impose deterrent sentences on the duo for their illegal behaviours.The defendants were earlier found guilty of one count of conspiracy to defraud, contrary to Common Law.The case arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent ICAC enquiries revealed the above offence.The court heard that in April 2008, the Environmental Protection Department launched the Cleaner Production Partnership Programme (the Programme) providing funding to encourage and facilitate Hong Kong-owned factories in Guangdong and Hong Kong to adopt clean production technologies and practices. The Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) was the implementation agent for the Programme.Applicants for funding under the Programme must comply with the relevant procurement guidelines.

Wong was an assistant of the company.Upon Tsui’s recommendation, a printing company in Hong Kong engaged Tomi Fuji to install an environmental-friendly air-conditioning system and apply for funding under the Programme with the HKPC. In July 2014, the HKPC received an application of the printing company filed via Wong’s email for a funding of $300,000.In October 2014, Tsui instructed another employee of Tomi Fuji to submit a quotation of Tomi Fuji and four false quotations of four other engineering companies to the HKPC. The price quoted by Tomi Fuji was the lowest in comparison with those shown in the false quotations.Believing that the printing company had complied with the relevant procurement guidelines to obtain five written quotations, the HKPC approved the printing company’s funding application in December 2014. After Tomi Fuji completed the installation of the air-conditioning system, the HKPC released funding of $290,000 to the printing company in August 2016.ICAC enquiries revealed that the four engineering companies had never prepared and issued the four quotations submitted to the HKPC. The false quotations were in fact prepared by Wong and the aforesaid employee of Tomi Fuji upon Tsui’s instruction. The HKPC, the printing company and the four engineering companies concerned had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Public Prosecutor Anthea Kwok, assisted by ICAC officer Eric Siu.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1163.html

Three days later, the defendant attended the interview.On both occasions, the ICAC investigator reminded the defendant of the provision of Section 30 of the POBO which prohibited him from disclosing the identities of the subjects and details of the ICAC investigation to any other persons. The defendant replied on both occasions that he understood.On June 29, 2020, the defendant told two senior sports executives of the executive committee of the HKBA that he had been interviewed by the ICAC regarding the corruption complaint concerned. The defendant also told the duo that he wanted to brief them in advance since he thought the ICAC would contact them later.The defendant understood that it was his duty to keep the investigation confidential, but he had still disclosed the identities of subjects and details of the ICAC investigation to the aforesaid duo, the court heard.The prosecution was today represented by ICAC officer Raymond Lai.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1141.html
12/7/2021,Defeated candidate charged with providing entertainment at DC Election and bribing electors,"A defeated candidate of the 2019 District Council (DC) Election was charged by the ICAC today (July 12) with engaging in corrupt conduct at the election by providing others with entertainment to induce others to vote for the candidate and bribing electors.The ICAC investigation arose from a complaint alleging breaches of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance (ECICO). Upon legal advice sought from the Department of Justice, charges were preferred against Au Chung-yin, 44, engineer. The defendant has been released on ICAC bail, pending her court appearance in the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts on Thursday (July 15) for plea.The defendant faces two charges – one of engaging in corrupt conduct to provide others with entertainment at an election, contrary to Section 12(1)(a) of the ECICO, and one of engaging in corrupt conduct to bribe electors at an election, contrary to Section 11(1)(a) of the ECICO.The 2019 DC Election was held on November 24, 2019. The defendant submitted her nomination form to stand as a candidate for the University Constituency of the Central and Western District on the first day of the nomination period, which ran from October 4 to 17, 2019.One of the charges alleges that on October 10, 2019, the defendant engaged in corrupt conduct at the 2019 DC Election by providing entertainment, namely a singing performance, for another person for the purpose of inducing the other person to vote for the defendant at the election.Another charge alleges that on October 16, 2019, the defendant engaged in corrupt conduct at the 2019 DC Election by, without reasonable excuse, offering an advantage, namely a calligraphy class, to another person as an inducement for the other person to vote for her at the election.ICAC enquiries revealed that upon the invitation of the defendant, two buskers made a one-hour singing performance near an exit of an MTR station in the constituency on October 10, 2019. Six days later, the defendant organised a one-hour free calligraphy class on the same spot on October 16, 2019.During the singing performance and the calligraphy class, a roll-up banner containing the name and portrait of the defendant was set up on the spot. The defendant was in attendance on both occasions while her election helpers distributed some handbills, which were filed as election advertisements, to passers-by.The defendant subsequently paid $1,200 and $800 respectively to the buskers and the calligraphist as remuneration and declared the spending as her election expenses in the Election Return.The Registration and Electoral Office has rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.An ICAC spokesperson reminds candidates and election agents and helpers that providing others with refreshments and entertainment at an election and bribing electors are serious offences.According to Section 11 of the ECICO, it is a corrupt conduct for any person to offer an advantage to electors for inducing them to vote or not to vote for a particular candidate or particular candidates at an election.Section 12 of the ECICO states that it is a corrupt conduct for any person to provide or meet all or part of the cost of providing food, drink or entertainment for another person for the purpose of inducing the other person or a third person to vote or not to vote for a particular candidate or particular candidates at an election.“Candidates should familiarise themselves with provisions of the ECICO and should refrain from offering advantages, food, drinks or entertainment during an election in exchange for votes,” the ICAC spokesperson added.Over the years, the ICAC has carried out various tailor-made education and publicity campaigns for public elections to remind candidates, election agents and voters to abide by the ECICO and promote a clean election culture in the community. Anti-bribery messages have been hammered home to election stakeholders and members of the public in a wide range of activities and reference materials, such as briefings, district projects, online and offline promotions, information booklets for candidates, education videos, leaflets, etc. The ICAC has launched related programmes for the coming public elections.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1140.html
9/7/2021,Ex-manager of groceries retailer gets three years’ jail for accepting bribes,"A former sourcing manager of a multinational groceries retailer, charged by the ICAC with bribery, was today (July 9) sentenced to three years’ imprisonment at the District Court for accepting totalling over US$615,000 (about HK$4.8 million) in illegal rebate and loan and loan releases in the sum of about US$45,000 (about HK$350,000) from a supplier for placing toy orders worth totalling over US$20 million (about HK$156 million).Pang Chun-kin, 39, former sourcing manager of Tesco International Sourcing Limited (Tesco Sourcing), was ordered by Deputy District Judge Mr Peter Hui Shiu-keung to pay over US$390,000 (about HK$3 million) as restitution to Tesco Sourcing, which was equivalent to the illegal rebates received by the defendant.In sentencing, the Deputy District Judge reprimanded the defendant for breaching the trust placed on him. Although the defendant did not orchestrate the bribery scam, his culpability equalled that of the instigator as the scam involved a substantial amount of bribes and lasted over seven years.The defendant earlier pleaded guilty to three charges—two of conspiracy for an agent to accept an advantage, both contrary to section 9(1)(a) of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO) and Section 159A of the Crimes Ordinance, and one of agent accepting an advantage, contrary to section 9(1)(a) of the POBO.The court heard that the defendant joined Tesco Sourcing in 2006 and was promoted to sourcing manager in 2015. He was responsible for placing orders of toys and miscellaneous items with suppliers, designated and agreed by a senior buying manager of a sister company of Tesco Sourcing stationed in the UK, for their parent company.In 2011, the defendant and the senior buying manager sought to obtain funding to start their own business. At the senior buying manager’s suggestion, the defendant solicited rebates from the operator of a toy supplier of Tesco Sourcing, who agreed to pay three per cent of the amount of orders placed by Tesco Sourcing with the toy supplier handled by the defendant and the said senior buying manager.Between March 23, 2011 and October 21, 2014, illegal rebates amounted to about US$ 500,000 (about HK$3.9 million) were paid to the defendant and the senior buying manager in relation to business transactions between the toy supplier and Tesco Sourcing totalling about US$16 million (about HK$124 million).ICAC inquiries revealed that the defendant shared about half of the illegal rebates with the senior buying manager by paying cash to the latter when he visited Hong Kong.The court heard that the corrupt practice continued after the senior buying manager left the sister company in 2017 but the agreed percentage of illegal rebates was lowered to one or two per cent of the amount of orders placed by Tesco Sourcing.Between February 9, 2017 and January 27, 2018, business transactions between the aforesaid toy supplier and Tesco Sourcing amounted to about US$3 million (about HK$23 million). The defendant paid illegal rebates of about US$16,000 (about HK$124,000) collected from the toy supplier to another buying manager of the sister company of Tesco Sourcing.The defendant’s share of illegal rebates, totalling about US$45,000 (about HK$350,000), were offset as partial release of a loan of US$100,000 (about HK$780,000) which the defendant borrowed from the operator of the toy supplier in about March 2015.Tesco Sourcing, its parent company and sister company concerned, had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Public Prosecutor Marcus Lee, assisted by ICAC officers Jason Tsang and Samantha Laura Nichols.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1139.html

Upon legal advice sought from the Department of Justice, Wu Huali, 38, former insurance agent of AIA international Limited (AIA), was charged with one count of obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception, contrary to Section 18(1) of the Theft Ordinance.The defendant, who has been released on ICAC bail, will appear in the Eastern Magistrates’ Courts next Monday (July 12) for plea.At the material time, all newly recruited insurance agents were required to register with the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers (HKFI) via their respective insurance companies before they were qualified to sell insurance products.

Manulife released commissions totalling about $470,000 to Tam, and overriding commissions totalling about $280,000 to Tin in respect of the insurance policies concerned. The remaining charges allege that Tin made false instruments, namely five application forms for insurance products in relation to five of the aforesaid insurance policy applications purportedly signed by five policyholders, with the intention that Tin should use them to induce Manulife to accept them as genuine.Manulife has rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1137.html

The deputy magistrate also ordered the defendant to pay RMB150,000 as restitution to the manufacturer concerned.The court heard that at the material time, the defendant was the managing director of Orderly Industrial, a garment trading company which engaged a Mainland factory to manufacture its apparel. According to an agreement, the factory would usually share 70 per cent of the price paid by clients of Orderly Industrial.The defendant was responsible for the operation of Orderly Industrial and was authorised to operate a bank account of the company for settling payments and expenses.In early December 2018, the defendant asked the major partner of the aforesaid Mainland factory for a loan but his request was declined by the latter. On two other occasions, the defendant told the major partner that Orderly Industrial would not settle the outstanding payments due to the factory if the major partner refused to lend him money.In addition, the defendant implied that the agreed percentage share between Orderly Industrial and the factory in relation to future purchase orders would be no longer maintained.Under the defendant's duress, the major partner eventually agreed to provide the defendant with a loan of RMB150,000, but the loan was never repaid.The court also heard that since November 2017, the defendant engaged a freelance designer to do design work for Orderly Industrial at a monthly salary of HK$15,000, but the defendant ceased to engage the latter’s service in July 2018.During an internal audit in April 2019, the owner of Orderly Industrial found that sums recorded as design fees paid to the designer, totalling HK$150,000, were transferred from the account of Orderly Industrial to the defendant’s personal account on 12 occasions between August 1, 2018 and April 24, 2019.Orderly Industrial had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by solicitor Louisa Lai, assisted by ICAC officer Gavin Lau.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1134.html

The prosecution offered no evidence against Yeung’s son Yau Man-kit, 29, who faced the same charge. In sentencing, Magistrate Ms Amy Chan Wai-mun remarked that this case was a classical breach of trust. She took a starting point of 24 months’ imprisonment, having considered the seriousness of the offence and the long period it lasted. Yeung’s jail term was reduced to 13 months in view of her guilty plea, willingness to make a full compensation and other mitigating factors.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent enquiries revealed the above offence.The court heard that Law’s Cleaning was a contractor of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) providing street cleansing services in Sham Shui Po between June 2017 and May 2019.During the period, Yeung was a contract manager of Law’s Cleaning posted to Sham Shui Po. She was responsible for recruiting cleaning workers as well as preparing and submitting their attendance records to Law’s Cleaning for calculation of salary payments.A contract showed that Yau was a cleaning worker of Law’s Cleaning. At the same time, he was a full-time employee of a pharmacy in Tsuen Wan.Between June 2017 and May 2019, the attendance records prepared and submitted by Yeung showed that Yau had worked for a total of 646 days, for which Law’s Cleaning had released salary payments totalling over $240,000 to Yau.ICAC investigation revealed that on most of the dates during the aforesaid period, Yau’s working hours shown on his attendance records of Law’s Cleaning and the aforesaid pharmacy were overlapping.

7/7/2021,"ICAC rises to challenges and continues to uphold integrity culture in Hong Kong, latest annual report reveals","The ICAC remained steadfast and continued to uphold the probity culture in Hong Kong in the face of unprecedented adversities brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the 2020 ICAC Annual Report released today (July 7).Tabling the annual report at the Legislative Council (LegCo) today, Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Corruption and legislator Mr Martin Liao Cheung-kong remarked that the ICAC had demonstrated its unrelenting determination despite 2020 was a year fraught with challenges.“Notwithstanding the adversities brought by coronavirus pandemic, geopolitical tensions and destruction made by some radicals, the ICAC has remained steadfast and unwavering in discharging its anti-corruption mission through law enforcement, prevention and community education,” Mr Liao said.In 2020, the ICAC received 1,924 non-election related corruption complaints, representing a drop of 16 per cent when compared with 2019. Mr Liao noted that the decrease of corruption complaints was due to a notable drop in that concerning the private sector, which was likely caused by a substantial decline in economic activities during the pandemic and the public’s preoccupation with other socio-economic issues.Moreover, a total of 868 complaints alleging breaches of the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance were received.  Among them were 850 complaints concerning the District Council Election held in November 2019 while the rest were related to the LegCo Election originally scheduled for September last year. Mr Liao noted that Hong Kong continued to have a low level of corruption. In the 2020 ICAC Annual Survey, 98.4 per cent of the respondents said they had not encountered corruption personally in the past 12 months.In the Commissioner’s Review of the annual report, ICAC Commissioner Mr Simon Peh Yun-lu said ICAC had gone through ups and downs with the city in the past 46 years.  The graft buster had shown its persistence in upholding the rule of law and maintaining Hong Kong as one of the cleanest cities in the world.  “Facing the roller coaster of changes in the past year, the ICAC remained persevered and carried on with its mission to combat corruption in both public and private sectors, promoting the values of rule of law and probity among different strata of the society and engaging the public to foster a clean society,” Mr Peh said.The Commissioner noted that the ICAC had adopted flexible measures to ensure the efficacy of its work under the coronavirus pandemic.“Despite the pandemic and the special work arrangements, the ICAC continues to take robust enforcement actions by pursuing each complaint and handling all investigations professionally and impartially,” he added. The ICAC also made meticulous efforts in offering corruption prevention service.  During the year, the ICAC completed 65 assignment reports and offered tailored corruption prevention advice on over 970 occasions to assist both public and private sectors to plug loopholes in their systems and procedures that might give rise to corrupt practices. On the education front, the ICAC reached the community and disseminate integrity messages to members of the public by adopting a flexible and resilient approach.  By combining face-to-face outreach with online activities amidst social distancing measures, the Commission organised over 700 online anti-corruption talks and training last year.Noting that the LegCo Election and the Election Committee Subsector Election would be held in 2021, Mr Peh said the ICAC would go all out to ensure the integrity of the elections and enforce the Elections (Corrupt & Illegal Conduct) Ordinance professionally and effectively. Meanwhile, in 2020 the ICAC continued to collaborate with its international anti-graft counterparts via online platforms.  Apart from organising online capacity building programmes for various overseas anti-corruption agencies, the Commission also participated in international webinars to share its graft-fighting experience.As an Executive Committee member and the Training Committee convenor of the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities (IAACA), the ICAC proactively helped map out training initiatives for the IAACA and provided advisory services for its member organisations, Mr Peh noted.After the first tripartite meeting with the heads of the Guangdong Provincial Commission of Supervision and the Commission Against Corruption of Macao held in May 2019, the ICAC maintained ongoing liaison with the two parties with a view to organising the second tripartite meeting in future.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1131.html
6/7/2021,Ex-manager of lighting product company admits fraud involving $12m discount and subsidy,"A former manager of a lighting product company, charged by the ICAC, today (July 6) admitted at the District Court that he had defrauded his then employer by concealing his wife’s interest in a trading company when handling transactions between the two companies involving sums of discount and subsidy totalling about $12 million.Leung Chun-hei, 41, former senior sales manager of Philips Lighting Hong Kong Limited (Philips Lighting), pleaded guilty to one count of fraud, contrary to Section 16A(1) of the Theft Ordinance. Another similar charge against the defendant was left on file at the District Court.Judge Mrs Adriana Noelle Tse Ching adjourned the case to August 5 for sentence. The defendant was remanded in the custody of the Correctional Services Department.The ICAC investigation arose from a corruption complaint. Subsequent enquiries revealed the above offence.The court heard that Philips Electronics Hong Kong Limited (Philips Electronics) was a company which supplied electronic products, including lighting products. The defendant joined Philips Electronics in April 2003. In February 2016, the defendant was transferred to Philips Lighting after it was set up to specialise in selling lighting products.During his employment with Philips Lighting, the defendant was responsible for handling orders placed by customers, including Supreme Profits International Limited (Supreme Profits)—a trading company in which his wife was the sole shareholder-cum-director. He was authorised to utilise promotion funds for clients to subsidise or give discount to Supreme Profits.Between February 2016 and November 2018, Supreme Profits had placed 3,848 purchase orders with Philips Lighting for total invoiced amount of about $107 million. During the period, a total sum of about $12 million from the promotion funds was used to subsidise Supreme Profits.The court heard that when the defendant joined Philips Electronics, he acknowledged receipt of a booklet of General Business Principles which stipulated that employees should promptly disclose any personal financial interest direct or indirect via a family member or acquaintance which could give rise to a conflict of interest.In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the defendant attended training conducted by an in-house legal counsel of Philips Lighting during which attendees were reminded to report any actual or potential conflict of interest to the company. But the defendant had never made any declaration to the company about his wife’s role and interest in Supreme Profits.Had Philips Lighting known that the defendant’s wife was the owner of Supreme Profits, it would have assigned other staff members to handle the transactions with Supreme Profits, and that it would not have agreed to the defendant’s suggestion to use the promotion funds to subsidise Supreme Profits.Philips Electronics and Philips Lighting had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation into the case.The prosecution was today represented by Senior Public Prosecutor Anthea Kwok, assisted by ICAC officer Ray Chan.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1133.html

His alleged involvement in illegal bookmaking activities was revealed in the course of an ICAC corruption investigation and the relevant charge was laid against him upon legal advice sought from the Department of Justice.

2/7/2021,Eleven in HZMB Project false concrete test records case have sentences increased up to two years’ jail after review,"Eleven former laboratory staff of a consulting firm of the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD), charged by the ICAC, were today (July 2) ordered by the Court of Appeal (CA) to serve up to two years in jail for producing false records on concrete compression tests for the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Hong Kong Project after a review of their sentences.In December 2019, the 11 defendants, who were convicted of a joint count of conspiracy to defraud, received sentences ranging from community service, suspended sentence to six months in jail.The Department of Justice (DoJ) subsequently sought a review of their sentences and the application was heard by Justice Jeremy Poon Shiu-chor, Chief Judge of the High Court, Mr Justice Wally Yeung Chun-kuen, Vice-President of the CA, and Mr Justice Derek Pang Wai-cheong, Justice of Appeal of the CA in April 2021.In allowing the DoJ’s application today, the CA increased the sentences of 11 defendants to jail terms ranging from one year to two years.The written judgment handed down noted that this case was particularly serious when compared with cases of its kind, adding that criminal sentences ought to be administered in a fair and coherent manner, otherwise public confidence in the integrity of the judicial system would be undermined.The original sentences imposed on the defendants were too lenient and had gravely and unreasonably differed from the jail terms of other defendants who pleaded guilty earlier on, the judgment added.The 11 defendants included eight former site laboratory technicians of Jacobs China Limited (JCL), Yip Tak-kit, Chan Yui-hang, Yiu Yu-fung, Yu Wai-tak, Lee Wing-fai, Sit Ka-chun, Cheung Ka-ming and Ng Man-hung, aged from 26 to 51, and three former laboratory assistants of JCL, Jo Chan Chi-shing, Tse Tak-lai and Lee Chi-kan, aged from 27 to 61.The jail term of co-defendant Kwok Man-fai, 38, former laboratory assistant of JCL, remained two years after a review.The court heard that at the material time, the defendants were employed by JCL as site laboratory technicians or laboratory assistants to work at the Public Works Regional Laboratory at Siu Ho Wan. They were responsible for conducting construction material compliance tests, including concrete compression tests (CCTs) on concrete cubes.The laboratory was established by the CEDD in late 2012 to meet the increased demand for construction material compliance tests arising from the construction of the HZMB. The management and operation of the laboratory were outsourced to JCL under a consultancy agreement.Two Principal Technical Officers (PTOs) of the CEDD were posted to the laboratory at different periods to oversee the services provided by JCL and to act as the Approved Signatory for issuing accredited reports on the tests conducted at the laboratory under the Hong Kong Laboratory Accreditation Scheme (HOKLAS).According to the required procedures, a staff member of the laboratory would place a sample concrete cube inside a compression machine connected to a computer when performing a CCT. He would then operate the computer and apply load to the cube at an appropriate rate until it was crushed.Upon completion, the machine would automatically generate a record slip recording the test result. After recording accurately the test result on a worksheet and signing on it, the laboratory staff should cause the test result to be input into a computer system for generating a checklist.The court heard that since about 2013, the defendants failed to conduct CCTs in accordance with CEDD’s requirements due to heavy workload and shortage of manpower.Between January 2013 and July 2016, the defendants and six other laboratory staff conspired together and with other persons to resort to a deceptive practice of manipulating the date and time of the computers connected to the compression machines, and using substitutes such as high strength concrete cubes and a metal calibration cylinder to carry out CCTs.Believing the information contained in the reports of CCTs were genuine, the two PTOs certified those reports under the HOKLAS, the court heard.The six other laboratory staff concerned were also charged for their roles in the scam. They were sentenced to jail terms ranging from 21 to 32 months after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud jointly charged with the abovementioned 12 defendants.The case arose from a corruption complaint referred by the CEDD, which, together with the Highways Department and the Transport and Housing Bureau, had rendered full assistance to the ICAC during its investigation.",https://www.icac.org.hk/en/press/index_id_1129.html
